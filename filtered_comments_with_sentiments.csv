If you want an epic Lord of the Rings gaming experience, this game cannot be beat.  During the game, both players must allocate their actions between the fellowship of the ring (either finding them or getting them to Mordor) and the War between the Free Peoples and the Shadow. Each nation has their own miniatures and the cards do a very good job of reenacting situations (or possible situations) from the books. The action dice are a cool part of the game that can force you to alter your strategy a bit, but still gives you a ton of choices.

ajewo,10.0,"War of the Ring is a complex, long, epic, strategic dudes on the map war game for two players telling the Lord of the Rings saga by Ares Games (This War of Mine, Swords & Sorcery, Wings of Glory). This review will give a major summary of the game, not all rules or elements may be covered.  [b]What makes it special?[/b]  * Thematic: covers the whole epic story and most characters of the Lord of the Ring * Dice-driven action selection with multi-used dice * Hand management with unique, multi-used cards (for either event or combat) * Asymmetric gameplay: defensive free people vs aggressive shadow player * The hunt for the Ring layered on top of a war game including fellowship management * Multiple win conditions: hunt for the Ring vs military win  [b]Pros:[/b]  + Artwork Characters are drawn (no pictures of the movies). The artwork for the cards and the map is very clear, clean, and well formatted.  + Very thematic Captures the whole story of Lord of the Ring including most characters, the hunt for the ring, and the war between the nations. Event cards represent certain story points of the book. The characters have different abilities and stats according to the books.  + Components Plenty of individual plastic minis (for each faction). Custom dice for both players. Standard white combat dice. Oversized cards. Quite inexpensive for so many miniatures. The big main board and the minis create a very epic table presence.  + Multi-used dice for action selection Bother players roll action dice at the beginning of each round. Alternating, both players spend a die to do an action depending on the shown symbol. Most symbols allow different actions to choose from. The free people player can spend Elven rings (once per round and up to 3 for the whole game) to rotate an action die to any side. However, these rings are handed to the Shadow player who than can spend these rings as well to manipulate an action die (luck mitigation, decision-making when to spend the limited ability).  + Finding a balance between war and hunt for the Ring The shadow player has to decide to sacrifice action dice for the hunt for the Ring to increase the odds and the pressure on the free people player. The Shadow player immediately wins if the end of the hunt track is reached. In my opinion, this interwoven hunt mechanic in a themed war game is what makes this game so good.  + Very strategic The politics track simulates that factions are passive at the beginning of the game and do not act yet because they are not convinced of the peril. Each nations must be activated and move along a track to be ""at war"" to remove the movement and recruitment limitation. Leaders are a good investment for dice reroll and more flexible army movement. Another important factor is that the deployment and movement of troops takes time. Furthermore, you can recruit companions and minions. In addition to new abilities, some also offer additional action dice for the rest of the game.  + Fellowship hidden movement  The fellowship move in a kind of hidden way on the map but may be revealed several times during the game. If revealed they are exposed for certain event cards of the shadow player (it is not a hidden movement deduction game like Sherlock Holmes or Star Wars: Rebellion). The free people player may move the unrevealed fellowship multiple times in a round. However, each time the odds get worse for being hunted. The number of Eye dice spent by the shadow player should also be taken into account (push your luck). The result of a successful hunt is determined by drawing a random token which may reveal the fellowship and advance the hunt track (or cause damage / sacrifices).  + Asymmetric gameplay The free people permanently loose units in battle. The shadow player can infinitely spawn new troops.  Both players have different win conditions. The free people play more defensively, they try to keep losses at bay, stalling the enemy, and hold their keeps. Moreover, the fellowship needs to be moved to Mount Doom. They may try to win by a military victory which is quite hard to achieve. The shadow player tries to conquer strongholds to score points for a military victory as well as to cut off and hunt down the fellowship before they reach Mount Doom. Both players have different decks of cards and a different number of action dice.  + Both sides feel very balanced.  + Fellowship management The free people player manages the members of the fellowship and may play event cards to separate particular characters from the fellowship. The leading character can be chosen who for the fellowship who grants a special ability each round. Moreover, characters in the fellowship can be permanently sacrificed to prevent the hunt track to advance.  + Unique, multiple-use cards Each player draws cards from two decks. Each card is unique. One deck mainly effects characters and the fellowship, the other deck effects troops and war efforts. However, some cards may lead to scripted gameplay, e.g., move Gandalf the Grey to Fangorn. I like that players can impact the battle by playing one card at the start of each combat round, especially because these cards have multiple uses (combat or event).  + Hand management with multiple-used cards Both players draw one cards each round from both decks. Action dice can be spent to draw more cards. The player has to choose from which deck (strategic decision). Each card has a upper event ability and a lower combat ability. Both players have to decide how to use a card: either for event or ability (decision-making). The hand limit is 7, so players are induce to play cards and try to prevent to be forced to discard cards. The decks are shuffled, so that players draw them in different order each game which makes the available options different in each game and provides replayability. Players may know the cards in their deck but they do not know when they will come up. Thus, they have to adjust their strategies.  The impact of a card highly depends on the right timing which is a big part of the game and the strategy. The cards provide a lot of replayability and fascination by exploring new strategies to play the game.  [b]Neutrals:[/b]  # Language dependent A lot of different ability text on the unique cards.  # Luck of the draw The timing for drawing certain cards can have a big impact here. Some cards are better or useless in the beginning or in certain situations. After a successful hunt, a corruption token is randomly drawn and may cause different effects. Depending on the timing, the damage can be big or low.  # Combat based on dice Depending on the number of units, both players roll up to five D6 dice. Hits are usually done by rolling a 5 or 6 (defending keeps and cards effects may change that). The shadow player must spend elite units to hold a siege in combat. Each present leader allows to re-roll a combat die and also grant special combat abilities. Since combat highly depends on die rolls, it can sometimes lead to very swingy outcomes (uncertainty).  # Long playing time and slow pace At least 3 hours. Slow movement pace for the shadow player and the fellowship - you see armies coming and have some time to react. Both players can get more action dice over the course of the game which makes rounds even longer. It is a big epic game.  # Table space Requires some table space due to the big main board  # Expansions available  They add even more (small, hard to remember) rules, units, and cards (replayability, variability, strategies, and complexity). The Lords of Middle-earth expansion is the best of the three.  # Big box Quite big game box that requires some shelf space  # Map can be hard to read There are a lot of minis that cover up the location names and fortress symbols on the map. The shadow player can replace the minis with up to three army tokens for better ease of use. However, it gets better better the more familiar you become with the map. Also annoying: the map consists of two parts that may slide and may form a crack in the middle. Improvement: the bigger map of the deluxe edition or the playmat (the playmat is quite expensive for its quality). I highly recommend 3D mountains upgrades (e. g., from Etsy) which make the map easier to read.  [b]Cons:[/b]  - Hard to learn The rules are complex: there are many small rules to remember and many special abilities (what is the special ability of this character?).  Some cards effects require or benefit from characters in a certain location. If you know these cards, you can position them in advance.  Usability: There are no hints on cards where a mentioned region is located on the board and there are quite many. Symbols for the unnamed faction tokens need to be learnt.  - Hard to distinguish (unpainted) miniatures Army minis are hard to distinguish because they all have the same color (red or blue). Painting them would help a lot but is also expensive (Anniversary edition) or time-consuming.  - Long set-up  Placing all the different minis on the board. It would have helped if the starting units have been printed on the board.  - Mount Doom track is too indirect and can be swingy  Tokens are drawn from the bag that manipulates the corruption track. The chances can be passively manipulated by putting additional tokens into the bag. However, it still feels indirect and swingy, especially if you draw multiple bad or good tokens in a row. I hate the ""roll a d6"" hunt token... The game finale thus feels rather out of control.  - Little luck mitigation  Luck is based on multiple factors in this game: roll for action and combat dice, luck of the draw for event cards and corruption hunt tokens. The action selection and combat depends on dice rolls. Players have some abilities, e.g., Elven rings, Joker symbol, leaders, and event cards to mitigate the luck of a roll but very bad rolls in a row or at certain times may be quite devastating. For example, sometimes the Shadow player only rolls eye symbols and thus cannot do much in a turn. Still, the dice rolls create tension and uncertainty.  - Rare rules reminder The game could be more approachable by putting rules reminder or even pictures on cards and/or board.   - No artwork I miss artwork on the event cards.  [b]Thoughts:[/b] War of the Ring is Lord of the Ring in a box.  [b]Similar games:[/b] * War of the Ring: The Card Game * Star Wars: Rebellion (2 players only, cat and mouse gameplay with more deduction: find the hidden rebel's base, hand management, stone-paper-scissors combat with rolling dice, less overall randomness, long playing time, complex but more easier to teach, learn, and play) * The Battle of Five Armies (2 players only, spin-off, more focus on combat, potential quicker playing time, less complex, story plays during The Hobbit) * The Games of Middle Earth (2 players only)",115746,en,1.0,neutral,0.7278181910514832,LUCK,"{'LUCK': {'negative': 0.015396774, 'neutral': 0.06832106, 'positive': 0.9162822}, 'COMPLEX': {'negative': 0.015396774, 'neutral': 0.06832106, 'positive': 0.9162822}}",COMPLEX

alexs34,10.0,"Excellent game.  As of 20170409, I've played this eight times, with six wins for FP. It's nearly always a tense game. I think it's actually harder for the Shadow to win than FP, despite Shadow's much more powerful army.  Cons:  1. Takes a few hours to play. 2. The miniatures look too alike and are difficult to distinguish. 3. A player who knows the cards has a distinct advantage over a player who doesn't know what to expect from the cards. 4. One of the detractors of this game likened this game to flipping a coin to determine the winner.  This is a reasonable criticism, since so much dice rolling and random tile drawing is used.  In one of my games, the victor was going to depend solely on the drawing of a single hunt tile.  I still loved that particular game, but it seemed to be an unfortunate way to end a game that took so long to play. 5. Other detractors said that this game is Risk with a layer of chrome on it.  This is partially reasonable, due to the dice rolling in combat, and moving soldiers in regions on a map.  However, the game has so much more to it than Risk.  I hate Risk and I like this game. 6. This game seems like it would take a few sessions of practice to really get the hang of it.  Pros: 1. It's an intense experience. 2. Long term strategy needs to be used.  It takes shape as the game goes along.  Seeing your opponent use strategies to confound your own makes things tense. 3. The game creates memorable moments.  With other games, I typically remember nothing and don't care.  With this game, I remember particular events that caused cheering or consternation. 4. The theme is superb, and it's easy to immerse oneself in the story. 5. Due to the theme, this game is a combination of an interactive story and a wargame. 6. The players can become emotionally invested in their characters and armies.  I believe this happens due to the amount of time it takes to see one's plans come to fruition.  This is another thing that adds to the intensity of the experience. 7. I find myself looking at the map and planning new strategies for my future games. 8. Even though there are only two victory conditions for each side, the way to achieve those conditions can take shape in many different ways. 9. The artwork is gorgeous. 10. Being a fan of Lord of the Rings definitely would make this game more enjoyable, but you don't need to be a fan of Lord of the Rings to enjoy it.

Only 2 flaws in my opinion:  - Games are very long and one could be reluctant to spend an entire afternoon or evening playing a single game. - The plastic miniatures are made with resin and thin parts such as spears or horses' legs can easily bend; but considering the number of these miniatures in the game, the choice of low-quality material is understandable.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.9719960689544678,,{},

This game is very true to the LotR milieu and the evolution of the trilogy story - excellent implementation.  Multi-player: 2/10  Meant for 2 players because there are really only 2 sides - additional players are sharing a side, not really playing independently.    Quality: 4/10  Lots of armies and unique units to keep it interesting, but the quality of units is lacking in 2 areas.  Firstly, the plastics are soft, and many of the pieces are twisted out of shape - some will barely stand; most spears and bows are warped, and so on. Secondly, while you are expected to differentiate between each racial army, they are all the same colour.  Given all the expense of producing this product, there is no reason why they couldn't have been different colours or shades.  Rules: 8/10 good rulebooks overall - our question sheet was much smaller than usual when playing our first game(s).

Aro2220,7.0,"It took me a long time to track down this game since it was out of stock in all the shops here in Canada. I finally got it and it wasn't quite what I expected...the setup was brutal and we had to stop a ton of times for rules clarification (the rule book could be more organized), but once we got going the game ran very smoothly and definitely had a good lord of the rings vibe to it.  I'm still happy I bought it because it's a game that is best with 2 players and that's usually the number of players I get to play with. The Shadow plays a lot more straightforward...but the free folk need to be a bit more careful of what they do and when. I feel like maybe Star Wars: Rebellion would kind of replace this game on my shelf if I got it since they seem very similar in mechanics.   Cons: The game takes a VERY long time to set up compared to other games. The game is rule heavy. The tarot cards are basically 2 cards in 1 with no graphics and just a wall of text with complicated effects that you need to really understand in order to be successful.  The dice rolls force you into a particular path to victory that may not be what you wanted to do. Almost every figure in the game is blue or red. This makes things very confusing as Rohan and Gondor and the north men and so on are all pretty similar yet come into play at different times based on whatever is happening with the political track.  It's expensive (high end of the gaming spectrum, not counting ccgs and miniature games which are in a league of their own)  Pros:  There are a ton of cool figures which are decent quality. The game feels epic. It seems pretty balanced (though it is asymmetrical) The production quality of the game is good.

I spend the entire middle of the game helping them heal in the Woodland Realm, while she destroyed my armies across Middle Earth. It seemed like there was no hope for the Free Peoples. The fellowship couldn't leave their safe haven, and I could barely protect them there. My armies across the map began dying. The entire fellowship, one by one, were dying.  Finally, I recovered enough that I could risk movement. I started sneaking Frodo, Sam, and Golem away from the Woodland Realm. By the time I reached Mordor, I could suffer only one more loss of a stronghold or the quest would fail.  I felt the hopelessness of the quest and spend at least two hours of the game thinking there was no hope, but doing my best in the face of that helplessness.  My timing, sacrifices, and strategy paid off, and with luck on my side (and a few uses of elven rings), I made it to Mount Doom with only a single corruption point away from the Ring destroying Frodo, and only a single victory point away from the Shadow Army destroying middle earth.

Aurarie,7.0,"As someone who finds great joy in mind-melting games, I feel this game takes the complexity too far. Mainly, I will join the voices which complain the rulebook is not very easy to parse. Personally, I am not a font of how many complicated mechanics and deep strategies one must account for in a game whose winner is often selected through a single, fateful dice roll. My bias against this feeling does not mean this very moment can't exemplify the high-fantastical themes of the game; the feeling, however, makes me frustrated.   For example, Warhammer has a similarly large amount of luck boiled into its strategy, but I go into that game expecting spiky turns. Regardless of how the story unfolds, I am satisfied with moving my units around and trying to get whatever advantages I can. In this game, a ""Good-side"" player might push their little advantages over the hours of gameplay only to find that once their Fellowship reaches Mordor, they get some really crappy luck and perish, even if they thought they had an amazing advantage.

bartlett010,10.0,"There are a great many Lord of the Rings themed games on the market right now and I think it is safe to say that this is easily one of the best out there.  The theme of the game is incredible and when I explain this to people, I often call it ""Lord of the Rings"" in a box.  When first looking at this game, there are a few things which stand out to people and the first and foremost is ""look!  It's Lord of the Rings Risk!""  That can not be farther from the truth.  While the initial reaction may be that statement, you soon realize with all of the decisions that it is far from just Lord of the Rings Risk.    Whether it comes from the decisions of the Fellowship of the Ring, or from a military victory, the free peoples can end this game fairly quickly if they play their cards right.  But the overwhelming decisions of what to do first can make it quite difficult for the free peoples to win the game.  The easiest way for the shadow to win the game is through a military victory, though it is quite lengthy.  The reason I say this is the easiest way is due to the decisions made by the free peoples.  If you go into the game looking to corrupt the ring bearer, the entire game is based on waiting for the Free peoples to move the Fellowship.  It seems as though they can control the timing of the game, which is one of the genius mechanics of the game.  The shadow has the obvious advantage in the military victory, but the Free peoples can control the length of the game.  All in all, this game is one of the best I have played in my collection.  Every time it comes out on the table, there is a different game which is being played.  While I have not yet played with the expansion, I am looking forward to it in our following plays.

The experience is greatly heightened by familiarity with the [i][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings]Lord of the Rings[/url][/i] source material, which is captured impressively well in the game.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.7873601913452148,,{},

BearDot25,6.0,"I finally got a friend of mine to commit to play this... and I have so many thoughts. Despite both coming prepared with learning the rules, we ended up playing for almost 8 hours total, which was completely ridiculous. Most of that was the first few rounds taking like 2-3 hours because of looking up exceptions and making sure we were getting everything right. By the end we were playing quickly--I think we could do a full game in 3-4 hours now.  I played Free People and he played Shadow. I think FP have a bit of an advantage in the first game; it's very easy for the SP to make mistakes and overcommit early on, whereas the beginning seems more forgiving for the FP (as you tend to gain strength as the game goes along). For example, he killed Gandalf the first turn, but then I just brought him back as Gandalf the White and made Strider my guide (who is kind of better anyway). We also got in a huge battle right at the start around Moria, and he ended up throwing way too many troops to their death trying to take the Elven Stronghold there because he didn't realize how difficult it is to take.  I also killed Saruman a few hours in because he left him alone in Isengard, not knowing I have cards that can kill him if he does that. He also let the Witch King die in a doomed assault on Minas Tirath, though that was mostly because I somehow got 4 hits in one roll. The result was the game was kind of over about half way through... by the end I won by military victory (I took Isengard after I fought back his siege on Helms Deep and sent Aragorn and a huge force rolling through the Southerlings), though I also had Frodo on the last step to Mount Doom in case that failed.  I also think he didn't realize how much of the game for the SP is attrition, then sending an overwhelming force to take strongholds. He kept assaulting and getting me down to a few guys but didn't have enough to finish me off. He'd have to slowly build up and move out again, but by the time he was back in position I'd rebuilt and was ready to fight again. By the last turn I was almost completely out of reinforcements, but still had all my companions alive except Boromir (of course), strong forces in and around around every major stronghold, and had Frodo in position with plenty of corruption left to take (I got him to Minas Tirath and let him heal back down to 1 corruption before moving to Mordor).  Overall, I think the game is a genius design. But we both agreed that it's very, very restricting and laboriously slow. It pushes you to do certain things so that the theme comes through, which I think is both good and bad. On the one hand, it creates great stories and makes the LOTR nerd in me happy. But on the other hand, there's not much room to be creative and if you are unaware of those restrictions it can bite you (like not knowing FP can kill Saruman if you leave him alone)--and if you mess up, you'll be dealing with the consequences for hours. I think my friend was frustrated by the combination of very deterministic gameplay, long playtime, and the luck of rolling (at one point he literally said"" I really hate this game"" after a few bad rolls), but by the end he'd learn how to work around all the punishing little rules and restrictions and mitigate luck.  All that said, now that we've played the game and know how restrictive it is, I think we could be more creative playing within the barriers the game creates for you.

The players can also take it in many other directions too, tapping into other areas of the lore.  The combat is focused on siege, which mirrors the battles and conflicts in the books too. There are field battles, but these will be skirmishes. The sieges are where the Free People's player attempts to hold ground and buy time for the fellowship to get to Mount Doom. This game feels like an epic struggle for the Free Peoples, trying to convince their allies of the coming war as well as fighting an unstoppable enemy. The Shadow is greedy but conflicted - trying to swallow up key cities and forces while practically being forced to hunt for the ring, pulling resources away from the war.

Bobcat Tom,10.0,"This game definitely lives up to its hype. But even before buying it I knew I would love it - I loved the scope, the asymmetric goals, the blend of long-term strategy and in-the-moment tactics (thanks to the Action Dice) and, of course, the Lord of the Rings theme. It truly is Lord of the Rings in a box... sort of. You end up writing your own story, and you actually remember the epic tales. Remember when Gimli and Merry quelled a siege at Erebor, then headed west to take over Mount Gundabad? Or when Aragorn and Merry, seeing Saruman building overwhelming forces in Orthanc, decided to abandon Helm's Deep and make a mad dash for a lightly-defended Moria? Most importantly, how did Merry end up on all these adventures? Most games that tell stories force you to read text after text to really be a part of it, but this game gives you a story you can feel - one that is driven by what you did during the game, not something you read.  As mentioned, I already knew I would love it, but I wasn't so sure about my girlfriend. She's not particularly fond of long games with many rules, and this game is certainly both of those things. But she loved it as well, affirming to me that I wasn't biased based on my love of LotR (she doesn't mind LotR, but she definitely doesn't love it). I should add that while the rule book is long, once you start playing, the rules all make sense in the game (the player aids are very handy as well).  It's tough to find the time or the table space to play this game, so it doesn't get played too often. But I can't imagine getting rid of it, because when I do have the time and space, I will be bringing this to the table.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.9714194536209106,,{},

briggsby,9.0,"Much like the unending interpretation of its source material, you could write papers on the depth of this war game. I feel about this game the way Gandalf feels about hobbits, because after the first game I felt like I understood it pretty well, but after 4 games I now know that it will never stop surprising me. I think that this is mainly due to the exceptional and jawdropping balance the designers have managed to preserve, while making the game sometimes feel so unbalanced in the most thematically appropriate ways. The free peoples will constantly feel like they are struggling to survive against impossible odds to destroy the ring, while the forces of evil feel like they're on a desperate race to destroy every last vestige of life or find the ring before its inevitable destruction in mount doom. Every game feels like a magnificent story with twists and turns and moments of desperation and pure hope, and it does all that while incorporating some of the crunchiest and well-balanced war-game strategy of the genre. If you like war-games, you should experience this game. If you like lord of the rings, you should experience this game. If you don't like either, this game will feel probably feel as imposing and sluggish as it actually is. I've only played this on tabletop simulator, but I imagine that the setup for this game is sloooooowwwww. And even in my 4th game we were looking up minor rules quirks or specifics about card interactions. And that's before even adding on any of the many many expansions which add additional cards and mechanics. Not to mention certain situations that can arise are so madly powerful and important, that while it feels extremely thematically appropriate to be completely blindsided by them the first time they happen, like the Ents out of Fangorn, it also feels very unfair, coupled with the crushing realisation that if you knew it was a possibility, you absolutely could and should have played around it. But that also just makes the strategy in repeat games more and more interesting.  Oh also, I'll just mention, this game has a really cool 4-player mode where you both control different parts of the two sides but with limited information about the other's hands. It works fantastically, and may actually be better than the 2 player version.  I could write about this game forever. If you have an entire evening free, and you want something that is both a super crunchy wargame AND a tense emotional adventure, then this is the best thing you could do for that evening.

Carter_Burke,6.5,"This game is for diehard Lord of the Rings fans. That’s because it takes a significant investment in time to learn the game, play a couple of games to ingest the rules, and ultimately (ideally) play against the same opponent. A newcomer vs an experienced player will be crushed.   Overall this feels like a CDG wargame that’s tried to integrate some hybrid euro/Ameritrash mechanics and aesthetics. The miniatures should encourage immersion but inhibit gameplay. Cubes or chits would be far easier to manage. Equally the game could use a few euro touches; like clearer iconography, and a rulebook with more images and examples.   So here’s my short list. But again; this is a game for die hard LotR fans which will see past the flaws and fiddle for the opportunity    Pros: +205 Miniatures are decent. (Soft plastic sucks but they are functional) +Board and Components are good quality.  +Love the huge double map! +Cool asymmetry between factions. +Some very cool mechanics; Eg. Siege mechanic. Politics track (factions need to be persuaded or attacked into war). Love the Hunt mechanic (drawing the hunt tokens reminds me of the Arkham Horror LCG Chaos bag).  +Rulebook has a “Summary” Glossary. Excellent.  +Gameplay allows “what if” scenarios to play out that are different to the movie. EXCELLENT.    Neutrals: #Event cards that mention a location need a Little map or grid reference to approximate where of the location is.  #Not much artwork, but what it has is excellent. #Ideally the miniatures need painting to improve identification; even if it’s just speedpaint with coloured bases so you can factions apart.    #Long play time - it’s not a negative but something to be aware of. 3-4hrs easily.  #This is a game you need to play every 2-3mths so you don’t forget the rules.    Cons: -Setup time is a full 30mins for one person. An insert may reduce that.  -Teaching the game would be a bear. (Maybe an hour?! Use RTFM’s video on YouTube) -Rulebook has pages and pages of block text with little rule exceptions. Non-wargamers beware! ;-) -Rulebook uses a lot of LotR terminology and lore you ideally need to be familiar with.  -Rulebook could really use more diagrams and examples. (Simple pic to show iconography for a town vs city vs stronghold… geez) Some MAJOR PLAYABILITY ISSUES such as… -Plastic miniatures look similar and hard to tell apart.  -Poor iconography on cards; and especially each faction on the political track (And how to link them to the miniatures they represent) is just egregious.  -Map locations hard to read when all the miniatures are on the board.  -cards have a lot of text to read… grinds down the pacing.  -Player aid needs a map with all the location names on it. If you’re unfamiliar with LotR or WofR, literally half the game time will be spent trying to identify where locations are.     If anyone has read this far, hope I’ve been helpful. I see and respect why this has been rated highly on BGG. Personally, a better and similar experience for me is Star Wars Rebellion.",115746,en,1.0,neutral,0.5249682068824768,,{},

casonpratt,9.0,"Excellent game! Very time-consuming but rewarding. Been thinking about it for hours since finishing (playing as the Free Peoples I lost).  I have 2 minor nit-picks which are design gripes, not gameplay gripes. 1 - It would be so much nicer if the different race figures were actually the same color as their nation/region colors. 2 - The instructions, game cards, and character cards have virtually no iconography. It is a text heavy game. I found myself having to re-read and re-read cards so many times to keep straight what does what or who can do what. This also made referencing the 46 page rulebook for rules clarifications a nightmare at times. For example, if playing a card grants you a reduction of a drawn hunt tile (-1), it would be incredibly helpful if that card had a hunt tile (-1) icon on it somewhere next to the paragraph that explains it. At a glance I'd know the gist of what the card does. I like the detailed explanations but when you're looking at 6 cards in your hand, 10 character cards, multiple played cards on the table all with word-heavy text explanations and you're trying to make tactical decisions it can be overwhelming.

cbazler,8.0,"Amazing game. If you've read the books, you will marvel at how much thought and detail went into the design to keep the game totally thematic—in the pacing, in the layout of the map, in the timing of the cards and the activation of the armies. It's almost as if the game presses you to make decisions that recreate Tolkien's original narrative, while still remaining uncertain of the outcome.   Take the map: Mirkwood, as we all know, is hard to get through (3 spaces), but if you use the Old Forest Road, it's easier (1 space). The mountains by Rivendell are impossible to pass, so you'll probably want to go through Moria if you're heading Southeast.   Like the books, you'll find yourself killing off Gandalf the Grey so that Gandalf the White will appear later. Sauron can continually generate orcs, so has an unlimited supply for recruitment (unlike the Free People who are removed from the game forever when killed). Some nations are hesitant to enter the war and need lots of convincing—sound familiar? So many thematic touches make this heaven for a LOTR fan.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.8829073905944824,,{},

cfarrell,5.0,"There is a decent module for this on Tabletop Simulator, so this is another game I'm revisiting in the era of COVID.  I can see why this game always drove me nuts! It's not actually that good, and it fundamentally misunderstands Tolkien. But it's kind of fun, you get to move stuff around on a map of Middle Earth, the dice occasionally inflict some drama. It's irritating in many ways, but also has a few legitimate interesting decisions. It takes way to freaking long. It reminds me a lot of Rebellion, also not very good, although it's probably better than that. It also really surprises me how many rules they had to use to do the two expansions - I think it could almost have been done exclusively with new characters, cards and maybe dice.   I think ultimately the length and dead pacing probably will keep me from ever enjoying this that much. There are two legit great Lord of the Rings themed games: Knizia/Kosmos' The Lord of the Rings, and ICE's Middle-Earth CCG. This is not even close to those games. It's also not even close to Sophisticated Games' The One Ring RPG. It's WotR-themed Risk, with a lot of theming. But that's not the worst thing in the world, in all honesty. As in so many things, overproduced nostalgia has a place. But that's about all this is. Star Wars: The Queen's Gambit is better.

I've never, ever felt like an asymmetric game was this expertly balanced - the constant push and pull between the two sides is nothing short of remarkable.  People talk a lot about this game being thematic, and as a deep-level Tolkien nerd I definitely agree this game does an unparalleled job of evoking the flavor of Lord of the Rings... but what's more impressive is how *dramatic* the game is. Lots of Dudes on a Map games just toss you a bunch of dice and mistake swinginess for actual, legitimate drama. But this game has the real deal. The way the two victory conditions are constantly progressing and each side is trying to find the best way to put pressure on the other, the way the game lets you make plans and keep secrets and then your opponent does something that puts you on the defensive and forces you to start taking risks, makes for a truly electric game where there's never a dull moment.

And the expansions are not bad either, some of them add quite the twist to the lore and changes to the gameplay mechanics. It's one of those games where you will have fun irrelevant of whether you were on the winning or losing side.

The overwhelming presence of Tolkien’s works, looming over every piece of media I encountered, felt like the Eye of Sauron—constant and inescapable. And frankly, it exhausted me.  But then came the day I decided to open myself up to the possibility of playing this beloved game, and now I regret not surrendering to Tolkien’s “corruption” sooner. War of the Ring is a stellar fusion of cinematic action and long-term strategy. Though the dice still refuse to do my bid, it’s the cards that truly shine in this dudes-on-a-map experience. Their dual-purpose design—both in and out of combat—forces tough decisions at every path of the road.  The journey is long, but that’s precisely what makes it so fitting to the theme. It demands time and careful thought, which only enhances the immersion. Looking back, I realize that another reason I hesitated to dive in was the artwork. Initially, it didn't impress me, but over time, it grew on me.  War of the Ring is an outstanding game, fully deserving of all its acclaim.",115746,en,1.0,negative,0.6069896817207336,,{},

CLPDDante,10.0,"War of the ring was a game that at first I was not so sure about due to how much of it there is. It is a pain to get out and put away. You have to have a full on session 0 by yourself and spend 2 hours just to learn the rules. It is one of those big monster games.   While I knew I loved the game after my first time playing it, due to how well it simulates the journey of LTR, I didn't know if it is something that I could brother to drag people into. But it does somethings different from other games of equal size that makes it work.   One of the biggest problems with complex games is how long you have to wait for your turn and how many edge cases there are that force you to look at the rules. This game fixes that by letting both sides play at (basically) the same time. You roll your dice at the same time and if one of you is attacking the other is defending. When you are not playing you are watching what they do because every move really does matter. They also greatly reduce the analysis paralysis by making it so you have to play based on what you get on your dice rolls. The game is also built upon a bunch of pretty basic game mechanics. I attack by expending the die I rolled. I move by expending the die I rolled. I play a card by expending the die I rolled etc etc. Once you learn how the hunt works you are basically golden. It doesn't try to re-invent the wheel it just takes a LOT of proven concepts polishes them all and says here is 3-5 hours of one of the best pieces of fiction ever created.",115746,en,1.0,negative,0.5066588521003723,COMPLEX,"{'COMPLEX': {'negative': 0.701744, 'neutral': 0.10805867, 'positive': 0.1901973}}",COMPLEX

cosmolsmith,6.0,"Pros: - Massive war game with mechanics that push you towards huge battles. - Decisions feel hugely impactful and you can imagine the theme based on the characters involved.  Cons: - It feels grueling, everything happens very slowly as pieces advance territory by territory. - The luck introduced by dice might not be for everyone. - Fiddly rules (you will definitely be referencing the rulebook, and the rulebook is not the best)  But one of my biggest gripes: the rulebooks and board just don't feel well thought through, especially for a 2nd edition. There are just so many small things this game could have had to make it easier to play: - Distinguish the armies better (different colors? Better figures?) - Add shorthand rules for things like the ring bearing mechanics to the player sheet as those are a big thing in the game. - There are definitely rules that feel important that are hard to discover in the rulebook (e.g. are the wring wraiths leaders for army movement? Yes they are, but it's not discussed in the army movement section, in the player sheet glossary it specifically says that Nazgul are not leaders. It's mentioned in the 'component figures' section of the rulebook...)  I feel like if everyone's playing for the first time you just have to expect that a lot of rules will be played wrong. But it doesn't have to be that way if the rulebook and iconography were better.  Overall, I can see that that this game can feel deep, thematic and strategic. I can see why LotR fans would love it.

cradleofmilk,10.0,"Played a bunch with my old first edition set too.   Amazing transposing of the LotR books into a light wargame. There are lots of little things to remember and weird fellowship mechanics, but after a handful of plays, it all becomes second nature.   Knowing your event deck is key to becoming a good player. I don't and haven't.   Really fun to attempt weird, novel moves based on your current hand and board position. Inventing a top-notch euro (TtA or Tigris, for example) is an accomplishment, but taking the LotR books and transforming them into a malleable boardgame of this complexity (while keeping true to the spirit of the series) is a real achievement.   September 2017 - finally played with LoME and WoME. These definitely make for a more immersive experience and let the player manage the details that are abstracted in the base game. And the directions the game can take are numerous now. I like the LoME mechanics. Not as keen on the WoME mechanics - they aren't clunky, but I find them a bit annoying. Probably just need to get used to them.  However, you definitely lose some elegance/simplicity and gain playing time when adding the expansions. I already prefer using the expansions, but it will be tougher to ""get to the table"" when adding WoME.   December 2017 -  Finally got off ass and ordered replacement combat dice.

Crossy,9.5,"Sell   Epic area control game just dripping in theme. On the first play it didn't disappoint and I consider it one of the best games I have played.   On the first play the free peoples (played be me) just won through a military victory. The game was extremely close and it could have gone either way (coming down to two key battles at the end). Unfortunately for the shadow players they couldn't take the Eleven strongholds for victory at the end.   While the ring bearers didn't complete their quest in the first play through it was such an integral part of the game. It forces both sides to balance their actions between progressing the ring bearers quest (or stopping it) and maneuvering armies on the board. The ring bearers essentially keep constant competitive pressure on both sides and acts in many ways as the timer in the game.   Having played Conan before this, I can now understand why many say it is pale imitation of War of the Ring. Having now played both, this observation is justified. War of the Ring is simply a great game.   9/8/14 - Played a second time as the free peoples and lost to the shadow military victory. In retrospect and upon review of the rules I made some errors which I will need to be aware of next time. The main one being it is legal for a force in the field around a stronghold to retreat to an adjacent region rather than the stronghold (I must have misread the rules, as the condition is 'may' rather than 'must' and the normal adjacent region rules still apply). This could have changed things. The other rule issue was that once a force retreats into a siege, that battle is over and the attacking army must recommence the siege next turn, and they only get to attack ONCE per turn against a stronghold. Regardless of these issues the outcome most likely would have been the same as I didn't play the fellowship well, it would have just would have drawn the game out longer, although if I had managed to retreat my characters I would have kept more dice for longer. Still loved playing and this is a great game.   ",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.936350405216217,,{},

darst333,7.5,"I like this game for its theme.  The theme is second to none if you're into the Lord of the Rings.  The dice action selection mechanism is cool, but can provide for some challenging situations when you don't get the symbols you need/want.  The event and character cards provide not just story but also strategic actions that can change the course of the game at every turn.  It's a long game that does an interesting job of telling the Lord of the Rings story while still making it a game with an uncertain outcome.  My main gripe is that it is a long game, sometimes overstaying it's welcome by the time it gets to the climactic conclusion, which will come down to a dice roll, leaving Frodo's fate to a handful of D6's.  Then again, that's what also makes it fun.  Overall, it's a good game with great mechanisms, but it's hard to get to the table due to its length and set up time.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.9565750956535339,,{},

The game has a learning curve, beware, but after a couple hours of studying the rules and a few slow rounds, it is not complicated at all. As a criticism, I found the game a bit repetitive after a few games since the Fellowship almost always will follow the exact same (shorter) route and never take alternatives which could make the game far more interesting.

de Gustibus,6.0,"For better or worse, this game is thematic. Nazgul fly anywhere, the Fellowship hides, moves, and gets corrupted by the Ring, the Free Peoples are reluctant to go to war, etc. This devotion to theme makes learning this game a chore, because the rules do not cohere. The central game mechanic is action selection based on the results of action dice. The Fellowship, Companions, the Hunt for the Ring, and Politics are awkwardly tacked on to various action-die results. Some rules are just finicky. An ‘army’ result lets you move two armies or attack with one. The ‘character’ result (a sword), is similar but only allows one move, and whether moving or attacking the army has to have a Leader or Character in it.    Oddly, the rules depart from the theme sometimes. Take Saruman. He can’t leave Orthanc. But once he dies, Isengard can still recruit. (And don’t forget that Saruman dies if an army dies alongside him, but he stays alive if alone when Orthanc is invaded, again for no discernible reason.)  So it’s a mixed bag with respect to game mechanics. There is, however, one thing that can’t be argued with: this game contains the worst graphic design decisions I have ever seen in a tabletop game. First, without painting the minis, or buying colored bases off of Etsy, differentiating between the various factions’ figures on each side would be incredibly frustrating.  Second, the faction symbols are totally unintuitive.  Third, the difference between a faction symbol showing that a nation is active v. inactive is the difference between it showing a thin beige edge v. a thin pale-blue edge. Why edges? Why are they thin? Why choose those drab colors for something so critical?  Fourth, and this may take the cake, the symbol for a Companion who can activate Gondor only (Boromir) is a white tree. The symbol for a Companion who can activate any Free Peoples nation is … also a white tree, albeit a slightly different one.  Fifth, there’s just no reason for the action die results to look similar yet slightly different for the two sides.   The verdict is that this LotR fanboy wonders whether this game, which is largely limited to 2 players, and which often contorts gameplay to match theme and look pretty, is worth the effort.

I love the asymmetry of objectives; the Shadow can be crushing the FP only for the FP to sneak the ring into Mount Doom because the Shadow wasn't paying enough attention to the Ring.

diceyroller,10.0,"5 plays of this game… an easy score of a 10! There is a natural bias, I came into this a huge fan the material, novels, films and tv show.  Let me start with my one and only negative remark. The miniatures. For the shadow player and the free people, it’s is difficult to distinguish between some factions. I took some time, and I do mean time to paint all the miniature bases. All 205 of them. Then I got carried away and paint the leader’s flags and cloaks of the fellowship. It was time well spent, as now setting up the board, arranging armies and then packing away is such an easy task. I have played this game with a friend who is just, or even a bigger fan of the source material, and this truly adds to the fun to be had here. We play the game getting excited about certain character action cards, quoting lines from the movies and getting to relive the Lord of the Rings story. The game provides a breadth of options for the free people and shadow players. Each game has played out differently. The game provides tension, excitement and moments of sheer desperation for the free people, pushing their luck in their quest to make it to Mount Doom.  Yes, there is a push your luck element to this game and playing as the free people with the ever-growing shadow army hunting you down, there are times where you feel you have to press your luck.

Took about an hour to read the rules and the game is simple enough once you get started.  It took us about 5 hours to get through our first game, it will probably take 3.5 from now on.

That's largely been addressed now as I've picked up the larger board associated with the anniversary edition.  The game itself is a terrific evocation of 'The Lord of the Rings' and it thematically couldn't be much better - if you want to relive the movement of armies, heroic defences, sneaky hobbitses etc etc , then this is the game. It works at the strategic and character story level baking most of the events into the cards.  I will raise two niggles   i - the cards can deliver some nasty, and occasionally unearned surprises, where one player can completely undo the work of several action dice just by having the right card at the right time. This can feel a little unfair at times - all of the event card type games exhibit this to some extent, the CDG's and COIN games.  ii - the combat system, is entertaining and provides a fair degree of player mitigation and decision making, and the sieges nicely handled within it without overcomplicating things but it doesn't completely escape the 'player that rolls most sixes will win' feeling.  They are just niggles as it's a great game to play if you have any love for Middle Earth - the proper (real) Middle-Earth that is, not the travesty inflicted on us by the creators of 'The Rings of Power'.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.44858214259147644,,{},

The action dice are a cool part of the game that can force you to alter your strategy a bit, but still gives you a ton of choices.

ajewo,10.0,"War of the Ring is a complex, long, epic, strategic dudes on the map war game for two players telling the Lord of the Rings saga by Ares Games (This War of Mine, Swords & Sorcery, Wings of Glory). This review will give a major summary of the game, not all rules or elements may be covered.  [b]What makes it special?[/b]  * Thematic: covers the whole epic story and most characters of the Lord of the Ring * Dice-driven action selection with multi-used dice * Hand management with unique, multi-used cards (for either event or combat) * Asymmetric gameplay: defensive free people vs aggressive shadow player * The hunt for the Ring layered on top of a war game including fellowship management * Multiple win conditions: hunt for the Ring vs military win  [b]Pros:[/b]  + Artwork Characters are drawn (no pictures of the movies). The artwork for the cards and the map is very clear, clean, and well formatted.  + Very thematic Captures the whole story of Lord of the Ring including most characters, the hunt for the ring, and the war between the nations. Event cards represent certain story points of the book. The characters have different abilities and stats according to the books.  + Components Plenty of individual plastic minis (for each faction). Custom dice for both players. Standard white combat dice. Oversized cards. Quite inexpensive for so many miniatures. The big main board and the minis create a very epic table presence.  + Multi-used dice for action selection Bother players roll action dice at the beginning of each round. Alternating, both players spend a die to do an action depending on the shown symbol. Most symbols allow different actions to choose from. The free people player can spend Elven rings (once per round and up to 3 for the whole game) to rotate an action die to any side. However, these rings are handed to the Shadow player who than can spend these rings as well to manipulate an action die (luck mitigation, decision-making when to spend the limited ability).  + Finding a balance between war and hunt for the Ring The shadow player has to decide to sacrifice action dice for the hunt for the Ring to increase the odds and the pressure on the free people player. The Shadow player immediately wins if the end of the hunt track is reached. In my opinion, this interwoven hunt mechanic in a themed war game is what makes this game so good.  + Very strategic The politics track simulates that factions are passive at the beginning of the game and do not act yet because they are not convinced of the peril. Each nations must be activated and move along a track to be ""at war"" to remove the movement and recruitment limitation. Leaders are a good investment for dice reroll and more flexible army movement. Another important factor is that the deployment and movement of troops takes time. Furthermore, you can recruit companions and minions. In addition to new abilities, some also offer additional action dice for the rest of the game.  + Fellowship hidden movement  The fellowship move in a kind of hidden way on the map but may be revealed several times during the game. If revealed they are exposed for certain event cards of the shadow player (it is not a hidden movement deduction game like Sherlock Holmes or Star Wars: Rebellion). The free people player may move the unrevealed fellowship multiple times in a round. However, each time the odds get worse for being hunted. The number of Eye dice spent by the shadow player should also be taken into account (push your luck). The result of a successful hunt is determined by drawing a random token which may reveal the fellowship and advance the hunt track (or cause damage / sacrifices).  + Asymmetric gameplay The free people permanently loose units in battle. The shadow player can infinitely spawn new troops.  Both players have different win conditions. The free people play more defensively, they try to keep losses at bay, stalling the enemy, and hold their keeps. Moreover, the fellowship needs to be moved to Mount Doom. They may try to win by a military victory which is quite hard to achieve. The shadow player tries to conquer strongholds to score points for a military victory as well as to cut off and hunt down the fellowship before they reach Mount Doom. Both players have different decks of cards and a different number of action dice.  + Both sides feel very balanced.  + Fellowship management The free people player manages the members of the fellowship and may play event cards to separate particular characters from the fellowship. The leading character can be chosen who for the fellowship who grants a special ability each round. Moreover, characters in the fellowship can be permanently sacrificed to prevent the hunt track to advance.  + Unique, multiple-use cards Each player draws cards from two decks. Each card is unique. One deck mainly effects characters and the fellowship, the other deck effects troops and war efforts. However, some cards may lead to scripted gameplay, e.g., move Gandalf the Grey to Fangorn. I like that players can impact the battle by playing one card at the start of each combat round, especially because these cards have multiple uses (combat or event).  + Hand management with multiple-used cards Both players draw one cards each round from both decks. Action dice can be spent to draw more cards. The player has to choose from which deck (strategic decision). Each card has a upper event ability and a lower combat ability. Both players have to decide how to use a card: either for event or ability (decision-making). The hand limit is 7, so players are induce to play cards and try to prevent to be forced to discard cards. The decks are shuffled, so that players draw them in different order each game which makes the available options different in each game and provides replayability. Players may know the cards in their deck but they do not know when they will come up. Thus, they have to adjust their strategies.  The impact of a card highly depends on the right timing which is a big part of the game and the strategy. The cards provide a lot of replayability and fascination by exploring new strategies to play the game.  [b]Neutrals:[/b]  # Language dependent A lot of different ability text on the unique cards.  # Luck of the draw The timing for drawing certain cards can have a big impact here. Some cards are better or useless in the beginning or in certain situations. After a successful hunt, a corruption token is randomly drawn and may cause different effects. Depending on the timing, the damage can be big or low.  # Combat based on dice Depending on the number of units, both players roll up to five D6 dice. Hits are usually done by rolling a 5 or 6 (defending keeps and cards effects may change that). The shadow player must spend elite units to hold a siege in combat. Each present leader allows to re-roll a combat die and also grant special combat abilities. Since combat highly depends on die rolls, it can sometimes lead to very swingy outcomes (uncertainty).  # Long playing time and slow pace At least 3 hours. Slow movement pace for the shadow player and the fellowship - you see armies coming and have some time to react. Both players can get more action dice over the course of the game which makes rounds even longer. It is a big epic game.  # Table space Requires some table space due to the big main board  # Expansions available  They add even more (small, hard to remember) rules, units, and cards (replayability, variability, strategies, and complexity). The Lords of Middle-earth expansion is the best of the three.  # Big box Quite big game box that requires some shelf space  # Map can be hard to read There are a lot of minis that cover up the location names and fortress symbols on the map. The shadow player can replace the minis with up to three army tokens for better ease of use. However, it gets better better the more familiar you become with the map. Also annoying: the map consists of two parts that may slide and may form a crack in the middle. Improvement: the bigger map of the deluxe edition or the playmat (the playmat is quite expensive for its quality). I highly recommend 3D mountains upgrades (e. g., from Etsy) which make the map easier to read.  [b]Cons:[/b]  - Hard to learn The rules are complex: there are many small rules to remember and many special abilities (what is the special ability of this character?).  Some cards effects require or benefit from characters in a certain location. If you know these cards, you can position them in advance.  Usability: There are no hints on cards where a mentioned region is located on the board and there are quite many. Symbols for the unnamed faction tokens need to be learnt.  - Hard to distinguish (unpainted) miniatures Army minis are hard to distinguish because they all have the same color (red or blue). Painting them would help a lot but is also expensive (Anniversary edition) or time-consuming.  - Long set-up  Placing all the different minis on the board. It would have helped if the starting units have been printed on the board.  - Mount Doom track is too indirect and can be swingy  Tokens are drawn from the bag that manipulates the corruption track. The chances can be passively manipulated by putting additional tokens into the bag. However, it still feels indirect and swingy, especially if you draw multiple bad or good tokens in a row. I hate the ""roll a d6"" hunt token... The game finale thus feels rather out of control.  - Little luck mitigation  Luck is based on multiple factors in this game: roll for action and combat dice, luck of the draw for event cards and corruption hunt tokens. The action selection and combat depends on dice rolls. Players have some abilities, e.g., Elven rings, Joker symbol, leaders, and event cards to mitigate the luck of a roll but very bad rolls in a row or at certain times may be quite devastating. For example, sometimes the Shadow player only rolls eye symbols and thus cannot do much in a turn. Still, the dice rolls create tension and uncertainty.  - Rare rules reminder The game could be more approachable by putting rules reminder or even pictures on cards and/or board.   - No artwork I miss artwork on the event cards.  [b]Thoughts:[/b] War of the Ring is Lord of the Ring in a box.  [b]Similar games:[/b] * War of the Ring: The Card Game * Star Wars: Rebellion (2 players only, cat and mouse gameplay with more deduction: find the hidden rebel's base, hand management, stone-paper-scissors combat with rolling dice, less overall randomness, long playing time, complex but more easier to teach, learn, and play) * The Battle of Five Armies (2 players only, spin-off, more focus on combat, potential quicker playing time, less complex, story plays during The Hobbit) * The Games of Middle Earth (2 players only)",115746,en,1.0,neutral,0.7278181910514832,LUCK,"{'LUCK': {'negative': 0.015396774, 'neutral': 0.06832106, 'positive': 0.9162822}, 'COMPLEX': {'negative': 0.015396774, 'neutral': 0.06832106, 'positive': 0.9162822}}",COMPLEX

alexs34,10.0,"Excellent game.  As of 20170409, I've played this eight times, with six wins for FP. It's nearly always a tense game. I think it's actually harder for the Shadow to win than FP, despite Shadow's much more powerful army.  Cons:  1. Takes a few hours to play. 2. The miniatures look too alike and are difficult to distinguish. 3. A player who knows the cards has a distinct advantage over a player who doesn't know what to expect from the cards. 4. One of the detractors of this game likened this game to flipping a coin to determine the winner.  This is a reasonable criticism, since so much dice rolling and random tile drawing is used.  In one of my games, the victor was going to depend solely on the drawing of a single hunt tile.  I still loved that particular game, but it seemed to be an unfortunate way to end a game that took so long to play. 5. Other detractors said that this game is Risk with a layer of chrome on it.  This is partially reasonable, due to the dice rolling in combat, and moving soldiers in regions on a map.  However, the game has so much more to it than Risk.  I hate Risk and I like this game. 6. This game seems like it would take a few sessions of practice to really get the hang of it.  Pros: 1. It's an intense experience. 2. Long term strategy needs to be used.  It takes shape as the game goes along.  Seeing your opponent use strategies to confound your own makes things tense. 3. The game creates memorable moments.  With other games, I typically remember nothing and don't care.  With this game, I remember particular events that caused cheering or consternation. 4. The theme is superb, and it's easy to immerse oneself in the story. 5. Due to the theme, this game is a combination of an interactive story and a wargame. 6. The players can become emotionally invested in their characters and armies.  I believe this happens due to the amount of time it takes to see one's plans come to fruition.  This is another thing that adds to the intensity of the experience. 7. I find myself looking at the map and planning new strategies for my future games. 8. Even though there are only two victory conditions for each side, the way to achieve those conditions can take shape in many different ways. 9. The artwork is gorgeous. 10. Being a fan of Lord of the Rings definitely would make this game more enjoyable, but you don't need to be a fan of Lord of the Rings to enjoy it.

This game is very true to the LotR milieu and the evolution of the trilogy story - excellent implementation.  Multi-player: 2/10  Meant for 2 players because there are really only 2 sides - additional players are sharing a side, not really playing independently.    Quality: 4/10  Lots of armies and unique units to keep it interesting, but the quality of units is lacking in 2 areas.  Firstly, the plastics are soft, and many of the pieces are twisted out of shape - some will barely stand; most spears and bows are warped, and so on. Secondly, while you are expected to differentiate between each racial army, they are all the same colour.  Given all the expense of producing this product, there is no reason why they couldn't have been different colours or shades.  Rules: 8/10 good rulebooks overall - our question sheet was much smaller than usual when playing our first game(s).

Aro2220,7.0,"It took me a long time to track down this game since it was out of stock in all the shops here in Canada. I finally got it and it wasn't quite what I expected...the setup was brutal and we had to stop a ton of times for rules clarification (the rule book could be more organized), but once we got going the game ran very smoothly and definitely had a good lord of the rings vibe to it.  I'm still happy I bought it because it's a game that is best with 2 players and that's usually the number of players I get to play with. The Shadow plays a lot more straightforward...but the free folk need to be a bit more careful of what they do and when. I feel like maybe Star Wars: Rebellion would kind of replace this game on my shelf if I got it since they seem very similar in mechanics.   Cons: The game takes a VERY long time to set up compared to other games. The game is rule heavy. The tarot cards are basically 2 cards in 1 with no graphics and just a wall of text with complicated effects that you need to really understand in order to be successful.  The dice rolls force you into a particular path to victory that may not be what you wanted to do. Almost every figure in the game is blue or red. This makes things very confusing as Rohan and Gondor and the north men and so on are all pretty similar yet come into play at different times based on whatever is happening with the political track.  It's expensive (high end of the gaming spectrum, not counting ccgs and miniature games which are in a league of their own)  Pros:  There are a ton of cool figures which are decent quality. The game feels epic. It seems pretty balanced (though it is asymmetrical) The production quality of the game is good.

I spend the entire middle of the game helping them heal in the Woodland Realm, while she destroyed my armies across Middle Earth. It seemed like there was no hope for the Free Peoples. The fellowship couldn't leave their safe haven, and I could barely protect them there. My armies across the map began dying. The entire fellowship, one by one, were dying.  Finally, I recovered enough that I could risk movement. I started sneaking Frodo, Sam, and Golem away from the Woodland Realm. By the time I reached Mordor, I could suffer only one more loss of a stronghold or the quest would fail.  I felt the hopelessness of the quest and spend at least two hours of the game thinking there was no hope, but doing my best in the face of that helplessness.  My timing, sacrifices, and strategy paid off, and with luck on my side (and a few uses of elven rings), I made it to Mount Doom with only a single corruption point away from the Ring destroying Frodo, and only a single victory point away from the Shadow Army destroying middle earth.

Aurarie,7.0,"As someone who finds great joy in mind-melting games, I feel this game takes the complexity too far. Mainly, I will join the voices which complain the rulebook is not very easy to parse. Personally, I am not a font of how many complicated mechanics and deep strategies one must account for in a game whose winner is often selected through a single, fateful dice roll. My bias against this feeling does not mean this very moment can't exemplify the high-fantastical themes of the game; the feeling, however, makes me frustrated.   For example, Warhammer has a similarly large amount of luck boiled into its strategy, but I go into that game expecting spiky turns. Regardless of how the story unfolds, I am satisfied with moving my units around and trying to get whatever advantages I can. In this game, a ""Good-side"" player might push their little advantages over the hours of gameplay only to find that once their Fellowship reaches Mordor, they get some really crappy luck and perish, even if they thought they had an amazing advantage.

The theme of the game is incredible and when I explain this to people, I often call it ""Lord of the Rings"" in a box.  When first looking at this game, there are a few things which stand out to people and the first and foremost is ""look!  It's Lord of the Rings Risk!""  That can not be farther from the truth.  While the initial reaction may be that statement, you soon realize with all of the decisions that it is far from just Lord of the Rings Risk.    Whether it comes from the decisions of the Fellowship of the Ring, or from a military victory, the free peoples can end this game fairly quickly if they play their cards right.  But the overwhelming decisions of what to do first can make it quite difficult for the free peoples to win the game.  The easiest way for the shadow to win the game is through a military victory, though it is quite lengthy.  The reason I say this is the easiest way is due to the decisions made by the free peoples.  If you go into the game looking to corrupt the ring bearer, the entire game is based on waiting for the Free peoples to move the Fellowship.  It seems as though they can control the timing of the game, which is one of the genius mechanics of the game.  The shadow has the obvious advantage in the military victory, but the Free peoples can control the length of the game.  All in all, this game is one of the best I have played in my collection.  Every time it comes out on the table, there is a different game which is being played.  While I have not yet played with the expansion, I am looking forward to it in our following plays.

BearDot25,6.0,"I finally got a friend of mine to commit to play this... and I have so many thoughts. Despite both coming prepared with learning the rules, we ended up playing for almost 8 hours total, which was completely ridiculous. Most of that was the first few rounds taking like 2-3 hours because of looking up exceptions and making sure we were getting everything right. By the end we were playing quickly--I think we could do a full game in 3-4 hours now.  I played Free People and he played Shadow. I think FP have a bit of an advantage in the first game; it's very easy for the SP to make mistakes and overcommit early on, whereas the beginning seems more forgiving for the FP (as you tend to gain strength as the game goes along). For example, he killed Gandalf the first turn, but then I just brought him back as Gandalf the White and made Strider my guide (who is kind of better anyway). We also got in a huge battle right at the start around Moria, and he ended up throwing way too many troops to their death trying to take the Elven Stronghold there because he didn't realize how difficult it is to take.  I also killed Saruman a few hours in because he left him alone in Isengard, not knowing I have cards that can kill him if he does that. He also let the Witch King die in a doomed assault on Minas Tirath, though that was mostly because I somehow got 4 hits in one roll. The result was the game was kind of over about half way through... by the end I won by military victory (I took Isengard after I fought back his siege on Helms Deep and sent Aragorn and a huge force rolling through the Southerlings), though I also had Frodo on the last step to Mount Doom in case that failed.  I also think he didn't realize how much of the game for the SP is attrition, then sending an overwhelming force to take strongholds. He kept assaulting and getting me down to a few guys but didn't have enough to finish me off. He'd have to slowly build up and move out again, but by the time he was back in position I'd rebuilt and was ready to fight again. By the last turn I was almost completely out of reinforcements, but still had all my companions alive except Boromir (of course), strong forces in and around around every major stronghold, and had Frodo in position with plenty of corruption left to take (I got him to Minas Tirath and let him heal back down to 1 corruption before moving to Mordor).  Overall, I think the game is a genius design. But we both agreed that it's very, very restricting and laboriously slow. It pushes you to do certain things so that the theme comes through, which I think is both good and bad. On the one hand, it creates great stories and makes the LOTR nerd in me happy. But on the other hand, there's not much room to be creative and if you are unaware of those restrictions it can bite you (like not knowing FP can kill Saruman if you leave him alone)--and if you mess up, you'll be dealing with the consequences for hours. I think my friend was frustrated by the combination of very deterministic gameplay, long playtime, and the luck of rolling (at one point he literally said"" I really hate this game"" after a few bad rolls), but by the end he'd learn how to work around all the punishing little rules and restrictions and mitigate luck.  All that said, now that we've played the game and know how restrictive it is, I think we could be more creative playing within the barriers the game creates for you.

The players can also take it in many other directions too, tapping into other areas of the lore.  The combat is focused on siege, which mirrors the battles and conflicts in the books too. There are field battles, but these will be skirmishes. The sieges are where the Free People's player attempts to hold ground and buy time for the fellowship to get to Mount Doom. This game feels like an epic struggle for the Free Peoples, trying to convince their allies of the coming war as well as fighting an unstoppable enemy. The Shadow is greedy but conflicted - trying to swallow up key cities and forces while practically being forced to hunt for the ring, pulling resources away from the war.

Bobcat Tom,10.0,"This game definitely lives up to its hype. But even before buying it I knew I would love it - I loved the scope, the asymmetric goals, the blend of long-term strategy and in-the-moment tactics (thanks to the Action Dice) and, of course, the Lord of the Rings theme. It truly is Lord of the Rings in a box... sort of. You end up writing your own story, and you actually remember the epic tales. Remember when Gimli and Merry quelled a siege at Erebor, then headed west to take over Mount Gundabad? Or when Aragorn and Merry, seeing Saruman building overwhelming forces in Orthanc, decided to abandon Helm's Deep and make a mad dash for a lightly-defended Moria? Most importantly, how did Merry end up on all these adventures? Most games that tell stories force you to read text after text to really be a part of it, but this game gives you a story you can feel - one that is driven by what you did during the game, not something you read.  As mentioned, I already knew I would love it, but I wasn't so sure about my girlfriend. She's not particularly fond of long games with many rules, and this game is certainly both of those things. But she loved it as well, affirming to me that I wasn't biased based on my love of LotR (she doesn't mind LotR, but she definitely doesn't love it). I should add that while the rule book is long, once you start playing, the rules all make sense in the game (the player aids are very handy as well).  It's tough to find the time or the table space to play this game, so it doesn't get played too often. But I can't imagine getting rid of it, because when I do have the time and space, I will be bringing this to the table.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.9714194536209106,,{},

briggsby,9.0,"Much like the unending interpretation of its source material, you could write papers on the depth of this war game. I feel about this game the way Gandalf feels about hobbits, because after the first game I felt like I understood it pretty well, but after 4 games I now know that it will never stop surprising me. I think that this is mainly due to the exceptional and jawdropping balance the designers have managed to preserve, while making the game sometimes feel so unbalanced in the most thematically appropriate ways. The free peoples will constantly feel like they are struggling to survive against impossible odds to destroy the ring, while the forces of evil feel like they're on a desperate race to destroy every last vestige of life or find the ring before its inevitable destruction in mount doom. Every game feels like a magnificent story with twists and turns and moments of desperation and pure hope, and it does all that while incorporating some of the crunchiest and well-balanced war-game strategy of the genre. If you like war-games, you should experience this game. If you like lord of the rings, you should experience this game. If you don't like either, this game will feel probably feel as imposing and sluggish as it actually is. I've only played this on tabletop simulator, but I imagine that the setup for this game is sloooooowwwww. And even in my 4th game we were looking up minor rules quirks or specifics about card interactions. And that's before even adding on any of the many many expansions which add additional cards and mechanics. Not to mention certain situations that can arise are so madly powerful and important, that while it feels extremely thematically appropriate to be completely blindsided by them the first time they happen, like the Ents out of Fangorn, it also feels very unfair, coupled with the crushing realisation that if you knew it was a possibility, you absolutely could and should have played around it. But that also just makes the strategy in repeat games more and more interesting.  Oh also, I'll just mention, this game has a really cool 4-player mode where you both control different parts of the two sides but with limited information about the other's hands. It works fantastically, and may actually be better than the 2 player version.  I could write about this game forever. If you have an entire evening free, and you want something that is both a super crunchy wargame AND a tense emotional adventure, then this is the best thing you could do for that evening. If any of those three things aren't the case, then you should probably do something else.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.7584200501441956,INTERACTION,"{'INTERACTION': {'negative': 0.17786482, 'neutral': 0.06591323, 'positive': 0.75622195}}",

Carter_Burke,6.5,"This game is for diehard Lord of the Rings fans. That’s because it takes a significant investment in time to learn the game, play a couple of games to ingest the rules, and ultimately (ideally) play against the same opponent. A newcomer vs an experienced player will be crushed.   Overall this feels like a CDG wargame that’s tried to integrate some hybrid euro/Ameritrash mechanics and aesthetics. The miniatures should encourage immersion but inhibit gameplay. Cubes or chits would be far easier to manage. Equally the game could use a few euro touches; like clearer iconography, and a rulebook with more images and examples.   So here’s my short list. But again; this is a game for die hard LotR fans which will see past the flaws and fiddle for the opportunity    Pros: +205 Miniatures are decent. (Soft plastic sucks but they are functional) +Board and Components are good quality.  +Love the huge double map! +Cool asymmetry between factions. +Some very cool mechanics; Eg. Siege mechanic. Politics track (factions need to be persuaded or attacked into war). Love the Hunt mechanic (drawing the hunt tokens reminds me of the Arkham Horror LCG Chaos bag).  +Rulebook has a “Summary” Glossary. Excellent.  +Gameplay allows “what if” scenarios to play out that are different to the movie. EXCELLENT.    Neutrals: #Event cards that mention a location need a Little map or grid reference to approximate where of the location is.  #Not much artwork, but what it has is excellent. #Ideally the miniatures need painting to improve identification; even if it’s just speedpaint with coloured bases so you can factions apart.    #Long play time - it’s not a negative but something to be aware of. 3-4hrs easily.  #This is a game you need to play every 2-3mths so you don’t forget the rules.    Cons: -Setup time is a full 30mins for one person. An insert may reduce that.  -Teaching the game would be a bear. (Maybe an hour?! Use RTFM’s video on YouTube) -Rulebook has pages and pages of block text with little rule exceptions. Non-wargamers beware! ;-) -Rulebook uses a lot of LotR terminology and lore you ideally need to be familiar with.  -Rulebook could really use more diagrams and examples. (Simple pic to show iconography for a town vs city vs stronghold… geez) Some MAJOR PLAYABILITY ISSUES such as… -Plastic miniatures look similar and hard to tell apart.  -Poor iconography on cards; and especially each faction on the political track (And how to link them to the miniatures they represent) is just egregious.  -Map locations hard to read when all the miniatures are on the board.  -cards have a lot of text to read… grinds down the pacing.  -Player aid needs a map with all the location names on it. If you’re unfamiliar with LotR or WofR, literally half the game time will be spent trying to identify where locations are.     If anyone has read this far, hope I’ve been helpful.

I have 2 minor nit-picks which are design gripes, not gameplay gripes. 1 - It would be so much nicer if the different race figures were actually the same color as their nation/region colors. 2 - The instructions, game cards, and character cards have virtually no iconography. It is a text heavy game. I found myself having to re-read and re-read cards so many times to keep straight what does what or who can do what. This also made referencing the 46 page rulebook for rules clarifications a nightmare at times. For example, if playing a card grants you a reduction of a drawn hunt tile (-1), it would be incredibly helpful if that card had a hunt tile (-1) icon on it somewhere next to the paragraph that explains it. At a glance I'd know the gist of what the card does. I like the detailed explanations but when you're looking at 6 cards in your hand, 10 character cards, multiple played cards on the table all with word-heavy text explanations and you're trying to make tactical decisions it can be overwhelming.

If you've read the books, you will marvel at how much thought and detail went into the design to keep the game totally thematic—in the pacing, in the layout of the map, in the timing of the cards and the activation of the armies. It's almost as if the game presses you to make decisions that recreate Tolkien's original narrative, while still remaining uncertain of the outcome.   Take the map: Mirkwood, as we all know, is hard to get through (3 spaces), but if you use the Old Forest Road, it's easier (1 space). The mountains by Rivendell are impossible to pass, so you'll probably want to go through Moria if you're heading Southeast.   Like the books, you'll find yourself killing off Gandalf the Grey so that Gandalf the White will appear later. Sauron can continually generate orcs, so has an unlimited supply for recruitment (unlike the Free People who are removed from the game forever when killed).

cfarrell,5.0,"There is a decent module for this on Tabletop Simulator, so this is another game I'm revisiting in the era of COVID.  I can see why this game always drove me nuts! It's not actually that good, and it fundamentally misunderstands Tolkien. But it's kind of fun, you get to move stuff around on a map of Middle Earth, the dice occasionally inflict some drama. It's irritating in many ways, but also has a few legitimate interesting decisions. It takes way to freaking long. It reminds me a lot of Rebellion, also not very good, although it's probably better than that. It also really surprises me how many rules they had to use to do the two expansions - I think it could almost have been done exclusively with new characters, cards and maybe dice.   I think ultimately the length and dead pacing probably will keep me from ever enjoying this that much. There are two legit great Lord of the Rings themed games: Knizia/Kosmos' The Lord of the Rings, and ICE's Middle-Earth CCG. This is not even close to those games. It's also not even close to Sophisticated Games' The One Ring RPG. It's WotR-themed Risk, with a lot of theming. But that's not the worst thing in the world, in all honesty. As in so many things, overproduced nostalgia has a place. But that's about all this is. Star Wars: The Queen's Gambit is better.

I've never, ever felt like an asymmetric game was this expertly balanced - the constant push and pull between the two sides is nothing short of remarkable.  People talk a lot about this game being thematic, and as a deep-level Tolkien nerd I definitely agree this game does an unparalleled job of evoking the flavor of Lord of the Rings... but what's more impressive is how *dramatic* the game is. Lots of Dudes on a Map games just toss you a bunch of dice and mistake swinginess for actual, legitimate drama. But this game has the real deal. The way the two victory conditions are constantly progressing and each side is trying to find the best way to put pressure on the other, the way the game lets you make plans and keep secrets and then your opponent does something that puts you on the defensive and forces you to start taking risks, makes for a truly electric game where there's never a dull moment.

And the expansions are not bad either, some of them add quite the twist to the lore and changes to the gameplay mechanics. It's one of those games where you will have fun irrelevant of whether you were on the winning or losing side.

The overwhelming presence of Tolkien’s works, looming over every piece of media I encountered, felt like the Eye of Sauron—constant and inescapable. And frankly, it exhausted me.  But then came the day I decided to open myself up to the possibility of playing this beloved game, and now I regret not surrendering to Tolkien’s “corruption” sooner. War of the Ring is a stellar fusion of cinematic action and long-term strategy. Though the dice still refuse to do my bid, it’s the cards that truly shine in this dudes-on-a-map experience. Their dual-purpose design—both in and out of combat—forces tough decisions at every path of the road.  The journey is long, but that’s precisely what makes it so fitting to the theme. It demands time and careful thought, which only enhances the immersion. Looking back, I realize that another reason I hesitated to dive in was the artwork. Initially, it didn't impress me, but over time, it grew on me.  War of the Ring is an outstanding game, fully deserving of all its acclaim.",115746,en,1.0,negative,0.6069896817207336,,{},

CLPDDante,10.0,"War of the ring was a game that at first I was not so sure about due to how much of it there is. It is a pain to get out and put away. You have to have a full on session 0 by yourself and spend 2 hours just to learn the rules. It is one of those big monster games.   While I knew I loved the game after my first time playing it, due to how well it simulates the journey of LTR, I didn't know if it is something that I could brother to drag people into. But it does somethings different from other games of equal size that makes it work.   One of the biggest problems with complex games is how long you have to wait for your turn and how many edge cases there are that force you to look at the rules. This game fixes that by letting both sides play at (basically) the same time. You roll your dice at the same time and if one of you is attacking the other is defending. When you are not playing you are watching what they do because every move really does matter. They also greatly reduce the analysis paralysis by making it so you have to play based on what you get on your dice rolls. The game is also built upon a bunch of pretty basic game mechanics. I attack by expending the die I rolled. I move by expending the die I rolled. I play a card by expending the die I rolled etc etc. Once you learn how the hunt works you are basically golden. It doesn't try to re-invent the wheel it just takes a LOT of proven concepts polishes them all and says here is 3-5 hours of one of the best pieces of fiction ever created.",115746,en,1.0,negative,0.5066588521003723,COMPLEX,"{'COMPLEX': {'negative': 0.701744, 'neutral': 0.10805867, 'positive': 0.1901973}}",COMPLEX

cosmolsmith,6.0,"Pros: - Massive war game with mechanics that push you towards huge battles. - Decisions feel hugely impactful and you can imagine the theme based on the characters involved.  Cons: - It feels grueling, everything happens very slowly as pieces advance territory by territory. - The luck introduced by dice might not be for everyone. - Fiddly rules (you will definitely be referencing the rulebook, and the rulebook is not the best)  But one of my biggest gripes: the rulebooks and board just don't feel well thought through, especially for a 2nd edition. There are just so many small things this game could have had to make it easier to play: - Distinguish the armies better (different colors? Better figures?) - Add shorthand rules for things like the ring bearing mechanics to the player sheet as those are a big thing in the game. - There are definitely rules that feel important that are hard to discover in the rulebook (e.g. are the wring wraiths leaders for army movement? Yes they are, but it's not discussed in the army movement section, in the player sheet glossary it specifically says that Nazgul are not leaders. It's mentioned in the 'component figures' section of the rulebook...)  I feel like if everyone's playing for the first time you just have to expect that a lot of rules will be played wrong. But it doesn't have to be that way if the rulebook and iconography were better.  Overall, I can see that that this game can feel deep, thematic and strategic. I can see why LotR fans would love it.

cradleofmilk,10.0,"Played a bunch with my old first edition set too.   Amazing transposing of the LotR books into a light wargame. There are lots of little things to remember and weird fellowship mechanics, but after a handful of plays, it all becomes second nature.   Knowing your event deck is key to becoming a good player. I don't and haven't.   Really fun to attempt weird, novel moves based on your current hand and board position. Inventing a top-notch euro (TtA or Tigris, for example) is an accomplishment, but taking the LotR books and transforming them into a malleable boardgame of this complexity (while keeping true to the spirit of the series) is a real achievement.   September 2017 - finally played with LoME and WoME. These definitely make for a more immersive experience and let the player manage the details that are abstracted in the base game. And the directions the game can take are numerous now. I like the LoME mechanics. Not as keen on the WoME mechanics - they aren't clunky, but I find them a bit annoying. Probably just need to get used to them.  However, you definitely lose some elegance/simplicity and gain playing time when adding the expansions. I already prefer using the expansions, but it will be tougher to ""get to the table"" when adding WoME.   December 2017 -  Finally got off ass and ordered replacement combat dice.  Chessex Scarab line:      Royal Blue w/ Gold Pips for FP.    Scarlet w/ Gold Pips for SP.   JUST CAN'T EVEN with those stock 12mm(?) dice and their ridiculous ""1"" and ""2"" configurations.

Crossy,9.5,"Sell   Epic area control game just dripping in theme. On the first play it didn't disappoint and I consider it one of the best games I have played.   On the first play the free peoples (played be me) just won through a military victory. The game was extremely close and it could have gone either way (coming down to two key battles at the end). Unfortunately for the shadow players they couldn't take the Eleven strongholds for victory at the end.   While the ring bearers didn't complete their quest in the first play through it was such an integral part of the game. It forces both sides to balance their actions between progressing the ring bearers quest (or stopping it) and maneuvering armies on the board. The ring bearers essentially keep constant competitive pressure on both sides and acts in many ways as the timer in the game.   Having played Conan before this, I can now understand why many say it is pale imitation of War of the Ring. Having now played both, this observation is justified. War of the Ring is simply a great game.   9/8/14 - Played a second time as the free peoples and lost to the shadow military victory. In retrospect and upon review of the rules I made some errors which I will need to be aware of next time. The main one being it is legal for a force in the field around a stronghold to retreat to an adjacent region rather than the stronghold (I must have misread the rules, as the condition is 'may' rather than 'must' and the normal adjacent region rules still apply). This could have changed things. The other rule issue was that once a force retreats into a siege, that battle is over and the attacking army must recommence the siege next turn, and they only get to attack ONCE per turn against a stronghold. Regardless of these issues the outcome most likely would have been the same as I didn't play the fellowship well, it would have just would have drawn the game out longer, although if I had managed to retreat my characters I would have kept more dice for longer. Still loved playing and this is a great game.   ",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.936350405216217,,{},

The dice action selection mechanism is cool, but can provide for some challenging situations when you don't get the symbols you need/want.  The event and character cards provide not just story but also strategic actions that can change the course of the game at every turn.  It's a long game that does an interesting job of telling the Lord of the Rings story while still making it a game with an uncertain outcome.  My main gripe is that it is a long game, sometimes overstaying it's welcome by the time it gets to the climactic conclusion, which will come down to a dice roll, leaving Frodo's fate to a handful of D6's.  Then again, that's what also makes it fun.

The game has a learning curve, beware, but after a couple hours of studying the rules and a few slow rounds, it is not complicated at all. As a criticism, I found the game a bit repetitive after a few games since the Fellowship almost always will follow the exact same (shorter) route and never take alternatives which could make the game far more interesting.

de Gustibus,6.0,"For better or worse, this game is thematic. Nazgul fly anywhere, the Fellowship hides, moves, and gets corrupted by the Ring, the Free Peoples are reluctant to go to war, etc. This devotion to theme makes learning this game a chore, because the rules do not cohere. The central game mechanic is action selection based on the results of action dice. The Fellowship, Companions, the Hunt for the Ring, and Politics are awkwardly tacked on to various action-die results. Some rules are just finicky. An ‘army’ result lets you move two armies or attack with one. The ‘character’ result (a sword), is similar but only allows one move, and whether moving or attacking the army has to have a Leader or Character in it.    Oddly, the rules depart from the theme sometimes. Take Saruman. He can’t leave Orthanc. But once he dies, Isengard can still recruit. (And don’t forget that Saruman dies if an army dies alongside him, but he stays alive if alone when Orthanc is invaded, again for no discernible reason.)  So it’s a mixed bag with respect to game mechanics. There is, however, one thing that can’t be argued with: this game contains the worst graphic design decisions I have ever seen in a tabletop game. First, without painting the minis, or buying colored bases off of Etsy, differentiating between the various factions’ figures on each side would be incredibly frustrating.  Second, the faction symbols are totally unintuitive.  Third, the difference between a faction symbol showing that a nation is active v. inactive is the difference between it showing a thin beige edge v. a thin pale-blue edge. Why edges? Why are they thin? Why choose those drab colors for something so critical?  Fourth, and this may take the cake, the symbol for a Companion who can activate Gondor only (Boromir) is a white tree. The symbol for a Companion who can activate any Free Peoples nation is … also a white tree, albeit a slightly different one.  Fifth, there’s just no reason for the action die results to look similar yet slightly different for the two sides.   The verdict is that this LotR fanboy wonders whether this game, which is largely limited to 2 players, and which often contorts gameplay to match theme and look pretty, is worth the effort.

dhelsby,10.0,"My first 10.  War of the Ring is a masterpiece that has made me enjoy Lord of the Rings more than I ever did.  The marriage between the theme and the game mechanisms is so beautiful. It is a long game - I can only see this finishing in 3 hours if one side performs terribly, more like 5 hours for me - but there are so many options that I spend any downtime planning my next move and am constantly engaged. The multi-use cards produce agonising decisions as you struggle to choose whether to use a card for it's action or battle ability; both of which you invariably need.  I love the asymmetry of objectives; the Shadow can be crushing the FP only for the FP to sneak the ring into Mount Doom because the Shadow wasn't paying enough attention to the Ring.  I'm lucky enough to own a painted version, for which I can only thank the person who was willing to sell it to me.

diceyroller,10.0,"5 plays of this game… an easy score of a 10! There is a natural bias, I came into this a huge fan the material, novels, films and tv show.  Let me start with my one and only negative remark. The miniatures. For the shadow player and the free people, it’s is difficult to distinguish between some factions. I took some time, and I do mean time to paint all the miniature bases. All 205 of them. Then I got carried away and paint the leader’s flags and cloaks of the fellowship. It was time well spent, as now setting up the board, arranging armies and then packing away is such an easy task. I have played this game with a friend who is just, or even a bigger fan of the source material, and this truly adds to the fun to be had here. We play the game getting excited about certain character action cards, quoting lines from the movies and getting to relive the Lord of the Rings story. The game provides a breadth of options for the free people and shadow players. Each game has played out differently. The game provides tension, excitement and moments of sheer desperation for the free people, pushing their luck in their quest to make it to Mount Doom.  Yes, there is a push your luck element to this game and playing as the free people with the ever-growing shadow army hunting you down, there are times where you feel you have to press your luck.

It works at the strategic and character story level baking most of the events into the cards.  I will raise two niggles   i - the cards can deliver some nasty, and occasionally unearned surprises, where one player can completely undo the work of several action dice just by having the right card at the right time. This can feel a little unfair at times - all of the event card type games exhibit this to some extent, the CDG's and COIN games.  ii - the combat system, is entertaining and provides a fair degree of player mitigation and decision making, and the sieges nicely handled within it without overcomplicating things but it doesn't completely escape the 'player that rolls most sixes will win' feeling.  They are just niggles as it's a great game to play if you have any love for Middle Earth - the proper (real) Middle-Earth that is, not the travesty inflicted on us by the creators of 'The Rings of Power'.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.44858214259147644,,{},

draidgen,10.0,"I am very predisposed to like this as I'm a huge lotr fan. This game is very thematic, the both sides play like how you would imagine in the books. The shadow forces are a large inevitable tide that if given enough time will win the game while the free people have to rely on tricks and subterfuge to attempt to destroy the ring under the watchful eye of sauron. The cards are full of references and match their function well. Once both of the players know how to play the game well enough it frequently results in pretty close games which have a lot of tension and tough decisions throughout. It's very much a tug of war between military and destroying the ring where as soon as the shadows over commits to one strategy the free people's player has to adapt their plans to take advantage of the enemy's current focus. Overall lots of fun, especially so for lotr fans.

DrNectarine,10.0,"War of the Ring is the perfect game for my friend and me. We are both avid Lord of the Rings fans, and this game plays beautifully - after the first time. After you play through your first rough time, the rules will come naturally the next time...though teaching this to a new player may become tiresome.  The map is super detailed, with a rule book that will beat you into a pulp if you let it. Luckily, the game comes supplied with individual player sheets that remind you what you can do each turn, which are very, VERY helpful.   The only true issue I had with the game were how similar the Free Peoples player's character tokens look. When sorting them out for reinforcements and such, it was difficult to determine if a horse rider was an elite unit for the Elves or the Men of the North or the Men of Rohan. However, this is easily solved by a taking 9 ziplock bags and sorting out the pieces, allocating 3 bags for troops aligned with Sauron, 5 for the Free Peoples, and 1 for the main character pieces.   My friend and I have played this game about 5 times now, but I have never played as the Free Peoples player. Every time we sit down, we have played the same side - I am Sauron and he is Frodo, which I see as a sign of a great game. It shows that the enjoyment of the game isn't based on discovering the new things in the game, but rather the enjoyment comes from figuring out new strategies and fighting to finally win one.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.9717825651168823,LUCK,"{'LUCK': {'negative': 0.08825832, 'neutral': 0.08535868, 'positive': 0.826383}}",

My first 7 plays were all shadow wins, but the 7th was very close.  I don't think this is as tight a design as many CDGs or block war games and strategically if offers something similar.   However this game does capture LotR on so many levels. It captures the epic of the war and the character struggles. Its a little over complex for what it is, and the onus is on the freepeoples player to strike for the win before the shadow engulfs him.

However the asymmetric aspect feels kinda flat as Sauron's goal is to just rush the fortresses of Free Peoples before they beef it up and turtle with elite units while Free Peoples have to rush the Fellowship into Mordor and throw their piece of jewelry into some hole. Not much of a wiggle room here. The option for Free Peoples to win by fortresses seems predicated on Shadow making some stupid moves and exposing itself or having bad luck on dice.  Rebellion seems to handle the asymmetric goals much better and characters feel more busy and engaged.  Also it's fun to think that ""canon"" Shadow ended their game with 0 victory points as they failed on every fortress they tried to capture.

Thoughts after a year: Every thing in this game is so thematic. I love how card draws at different times influence how the game will play out. It is always exciting to play next game, well not for a week after you played it. The expansions just add more theme to it.

EZBoardGames,9.5,A masterpiece. I absolutely love this game and everything about it.  It tells an epic story!  The game benefits from multiple plays because it is has fixed cards that don't change so the more you play the better you know what to expect.  I'm 'dropping' half a point just because setup takes quite a while and also it's only for 2 players (in my opinion).

E_Roll39,10.0,"Genuinely one of the most immersive, tense, and over-all epic board gaming experiences I've had in my life.   Huge decision space (with expansion further opening the possibilities) that let you take control of the narrative direction of the epic fantasy novel. All the characters and important events are there, but when, how, and even if they come into play will change with each match.   Fair warning, it takes an immense amount of time to learn the rules throughly (I suggest making a short list of the pesky, particular ones you are prone to forget easily) and requires a huge block of time to actually play if you plan on doing it in one sitting. I had to organize a separate session just to TEACH the game and do a few dummy rounds before I could actually get a full fledged game in.   It also should be noted that you are going to want to find someone who is well acquainted with Tolkien, as names of characters and locations will get confusing fast if you are unfamiliar. If you are a LOTR fan and have a partner who has the patience to learn the nuances AND will want to play a few times a year than I cannot highly recommend this more.

I absolutely love the way the game has the magical effect of creating discussion around it long after you even finished playing. Even though the decisions you make are somewhat railroaded by the action dice, YOU have to decide the best way to utilize them. And these choices are what define the game and what creates these interesting discussions long after.   Negative Final Thoughts –  The game was just too complex for my taste and just barely. I know how to play it but there are just a few too many moving parts for it to really climb the ranks of my all-time favorites. It really straddles the line of fun complex/unfun complex.

fyrian,10.0,"[b][i]War of the Ring[/i][/b] is a rare combination of great theme with great mechanics that work with the theme.   Allow me to give a sampling of the decisions in a round of War of the Ring. The core mechanic is the action dice that you roll every round. The dice tell you what you can do this round, and since you only have at most 10 dice it might seem like you don't have that many options. In truth, there are many possibilities (and this can paralyze newer players). For example, suppose you rolled 3 army results. Those dice must be used to mobilize armies on the board, but there are so many choices on where to move. Are you going to use those dice to reinforce/assault the men in Minas Tirith? The men of Gondor are strong, but conquering Gondor puts the Shadow half-way to victory. Or should you help/attack the elves of Lothlorien? It's a single stronghold, but shadow control of Lothlorien is an ideal staging area for moving in many directions and if you take it early you can hopefully interfere with the Fellowship movement. Should you wait until the end of the round when your opponent is committed to a strategy or should you perform your moves immediately before your opponent has time to adjust his strategy? And what about your newly drawn Rohan-based action cards, are these powerful enough to switch your attention to the horse lords? Meanwhile, what about your opponent? Should you set the pace of the game through aggression or should you only react to their actions? These aren't easy decisions, but they are fun.  Behind the military deployment is the Fellowship progression which acts as a game clock which the players partially control. The variable game clock is clever game design, and it's seamlessly integrated into the theme. So well is the theme integrated into this game that you don't even think of it as a game mechanism, but rather as the Fellowship marching towards Mordor. If you can imagine the Witch-King proclaiming ""Do you not know Death when you see it?"" as he smashes Rivendell to put the Shadow within an inch of victory while the Free Peoples hurry the Fellowship through Mordor as they throw caution to the wind, then you should try this game.

All while still boasting extremely solid gameplay and amazing strategic depth. Multiple strategies can be viable and every turn matters. The two sides play very differently, but are still quite evenly balanced.  3 major thresholds: (due to it's complexity) 1) Accessibility, to learn the game you really have to invest some time to study the rulebook. And even then you will need 1 or 2 ""teaching games"" to really grip the strategic options. 2) Length. Due to the complex gameplay a session will easily take upwards of 2,5 - 3 hours. Making it difficult to bring to the table. 3) Skill, experience, a new player has almost no chance to win against a more experienced player.  One of my favorite games of all time. I would rate it a perfect 10/10 if it was be playable in under 2 hours.

GeorgW,5.0,"[ImageID=1215633small] Thematic and swingy!  [b]Pros:[/b] I think that if you have any interest in the IP, it's a game that's worth it to play once. I'm happy to have played it, it's very thematic and I really like the asymmetry and dice action system.   The different card effects, and choosing whether to use them for the top action or to save them for their bottom combat action works well. There are interesting and thematic effects in the decks, but as with any of this type of games you need some basic familiarity with the range of effects to play competently.  The dice action system is really well done. I like the asymmetry of it, that the Shadow has more dice but must use some for looking for the fellowship. It constrains options in an interesting way, as sometimes one of the players takes a risk or rolls an unusual result, and the game is all about exploiting those opportunities.   The different characters and how their effects reference the source material creates a great thematic framework. I like that getting extra dice is especially relevant for the Free Peoples and how they must play to achieve that.  I really like the whole Fellowship mechanism. Pushing your luck trying to get closer to Mordor and choosing which path to take to either avoid risk or gain time. It's very evocative.  [b]Cons:[/b] I want to be very clear that this game was never going to be for me. I don't like big and complex games, and prefer cubes to miniatures. I also don't do well with dice. I like them, but I'm serious when I say that they don't like me, as exemplified by losing a 6% die roll in my one play of this, dooming my chances early in the game.  It's very fiddly with the many different, similar-looking miniatures and it took 5 hours to play in addition to the 1h teach (though I probably could have conceded a lot quicker once things started to go downhill if I was more familiar with the arc of the game).   But my biggest complaint is unsurprisingly the dice. 5 dice for combat is just way too few for me, it creates these wild swings that weren't satisfying at all for a game that takes 5 hours. If it was closer to 1 hour I'd be all for more swingyness, but it didn't gel for me with the rest of the game.   Also, with a game this huge with all of its chrome, why the hell aren't there enough dice for both of us to roll at once? If I was developing a 3rd edition of this game, all I'd change would be to put in 10 red dice and 10 blue dice and change the combat to use 2 dice per unit (a simple doubling) and for the hit results to be half as likely on average (probably using some comparative measure instead of a static check to make it feel more dynamic).",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.9534152746200562,LUCK,"{'LUCK': {'negative': 0.08206412, 'neutral': 0.028736014, 'positive': 0.88919985}, 'COMPLEX': {'negative': 0.08206412, 'neutral': 0.028736014, 'positive': 0.88919985}}",COMPLEX

Never going back to risk after this. Never liked risk actually. Anyways play this game! I love the attack of the trent cards :) It feels like a massacring lost cause for the non shadow races, but i put my faith in the fellowship!    For beginners always start as orcs, and do not hesitate to attack from the beginning! Use them hordes! The more time the humans have, the more of an advantage the orcs lose if they are not slaughtering.   As a side note someone who's played before will have the advantage over the other because they know the cards. I like to give the orcs a heads up to not leave orthanic unprotected cause the trees will come! And I also warn them that if they see the hobbit running towards the witch king watch out!  Actually, after more plays, I think beginners are good at starting as either or.  It looks like there is an interesting expansion that adds elven leaders that I'm interested in testing.

This game really lets you get immersed in Tolkien's masterpiece. WotR for first timers feels very one sided as the amount of little rules and exceptions that feel like they more hinder the Free Peoples player than the Shadow player. While this is bad in a technical and strategy sense, thematically this lets you feel the desperation the Free People had as Sauron and his army moved to take over Middle Earth and really shows the importance and weight of the Fellowship to destroy the one ring. But as I said, while thematically it's amazing, technically it is very difficult for the Free Peoples player to get a foothold and stop the Shadow Army from taking over Middle Earth. But for players that have gotten in a game or two and understand ""most"" of the rules, then this game becomes an addicting piece of strategical art that makes you see your downfall and makes you wonder, maybe if you just did that thing different, or protected that one stronghold then maybe you would have won.

Combat and sneaking the Fellowship are so focused on individual characters each with unique circumstances, there are too many specific moments that ask players to memorize rules and phases. Even if the learning curve is too steep in a game long enough where it is strictly a ""once in a while event game,"" each of the rules serve to create unique moments that tells the story of the War of the Ring.

Spent (literally) a couple of months (all of June and most of July of 2021) trying to get my head around the rulebook and watching (and rewatching) the excellent Ricky Royal play-throughs.  As a longtime Tolkien and Lord of the Rings fan, I had really high hopes for this one.  After loads of careful and patient research into the pros and cons of WOTR, I'm cautiously optimistic that I'm going to really enjoy the game.  UPDATE:  July 26, 2021.  Began our first game at around 230pm and at 10pm stopped to resume the game tomorrow.  I have to say, it's pretty amazing.  There is very little that I don't like about it.  Hasn't felt long at all - the back-and-forth has been very thematic and extremely entertaining.  My son really likes the game (he's a fan of asymmetric games where players have plenty of time to build up his/her armies/engines before final execution).  Also, it didn't hurt the experience that we played the complete and unedited TWO TOWERS soundtrack/score whilst playing!  The game really does capture the drama, excitement, tension and essence of the book.    I'm sure the game won't take nearly as long next time (we're learning and are not playing as economically nor as efficiently as we should be, and of course are looking a lot of things up so as to avoid developing bad habits).

hawk-x-,7.0,"In short, this is a lovingly made game that provides a platform for players to play out an epic battle between one another without too many mechanisms getting in the way.  War of the Ring is an amazing asymmetrical (yet balanced) game in which the (weaker) Fellowship must sneak through to Mount Doom through the (militarily stronger) Sauron player to deliver that one damning blow (i.e., destroying the ring). Not only can the the respective players win by setting out to achieve their goals -- but pushing too hard here might result in defeat as well: if the Fellowship recklessly sneaks to Mordor, they might fail and falter to corruption (i.e., losing) and if Sauron is too reckless in his advance, the Free Peoples might sneak behind enemy lines to capture a few places (i.e., losing). This risk/reward system pushes palyers into a dragged out match in which no one wants to blow their stamina on one final punch -- its a tense marathon match rather than a quickly ended street fight.  The diverse cards are the heart of the game -- providing the meat to incentivize different and divergent explorations of what could have been in Middle Earth (especially partnered with the potential range of choices provided by the dice). While none of them seem broken, there seems to be a great balance between powerful yet highly contextual cards and highly flexible yet less powerful cards.    If one can find any fault with the game is that it is long. Not too long -- as the game is quite engrossing -- but long enough that it might be difficult to schedule in that 4+ hours.  However, it is a 4+ hour stretch that is well spent, generally tense -- yet while simultaneously seeming light, breathable. A stupendous design. ",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.9076610803604126,,{},

In a recent game, just when the Shadow army looked like it could not be stopped, Frodo destroys the ring and brings victory to the Free People's army!  The components are very nice (high quality board/cards), but I do wish they would have went with different shades of blue for the different Free People's armies and different shades of red for the different Shadow types.  It does make it challenging for setting up and, at times, playing.  But, overall, we think it has great components.

Herakleitos,8.0,"A tentative 8 based on a first somewhat rough play, with the expectation that it will likely go higher. At first blush, I was taken aback by the rules density. However, I think that the game successfully 'earns' a good chunk of its overhead. This is due to what the game achieves through these rules; namely, a degree of thematic integration that makes the game verge on a 'historical' simulation.  It is especially noteworthy how the game handles the multiple dimensions of the thematic space, as it were. For example: siege battles send defending units off the map (e.g. into their 'stronghold') and the relevant map region becomes encamped by the sieging armies. This, thematically, changes the movement rules for that region - allowing the attackers armies to pass through freely while blocking the defenders' other armies. Similarly, the fellowship is sort of everywhere and nowhere at once (within a certain distance) until the player declares or is forced to reveal. This is an interesting and novel way of handling the hidden movement of Frodo - even if it is a bit unintuitive at first.   Although I've only played once, I found the last third of our game indicative of the 'actual' experience WOTR promises. Having finally begun to digest the rhythm of the game, my opponent and I started setting traps for eachother, feinting, triggering powerful combinations of the event cards, etc. I am looking forward to many future plays!

Not a fan of the Hunt for the Ring side of it, which sadly seems to be the only viable strategy for the Free Peoples player.  While I am not the kind of player who shuns long games, having to dedicate an entire day to a game I'm not convinced about does not do it any favours.  I personally really dislike the idea of the initial setup always being exactly the same, specially considering how the general direction the game is going to follow is also going to be the same most of the time.  ====== Forum comments - Lords of Middle Earth only essential expansion?",115746,en,1.0,negative,0.8631026744842529,,{},

imablackbelt,7.0,"An epic Lord of the Rings experience that is a bit too complex and fiddly for what it is. Ok as a dudes on a map game, but with twice as many rules serving the normal amount of strategic depth. If you don't play the game regularly you will have to refresh yourself on the rules every time you play, which for what essentially boils down to a dudes on a map game is less than ideal. Playing it can be kind of a chore. Rewarding, but still. It's a slow roll with not the most exciting start that usually manages to finish strong. It can be a real slog to play as the Free People against a not great Mordor player. And if you are teaching someone the game probably you will give them Mordor because Mordor has less rules overhead. Playing as Mordor is usually fun regardless because you are just crushing free people everywhere and flying Nazgul around and attacking Helm's Deep with the Witch King and it feels pretty great. Players looking for a more narrative experience may prefer the Free People though. In my games the Free People have a much higher winrate than Mordor. I wouldn't say that the game is unbalanced necessarily but maybe that Mordor is harder to play well.  The game gets 10/10 as eye candy, an ""event"" type game, a Lord of the Rings experience, and on theme. You get so. many. dudes. Really cool looking dudes. On a giant colorful map. Just looking at the game is amazing, especially if it is painted. And in nearly every game some things will happen the way they did in the books or films and other things will change because of your choices and you can live your Lord of the Rings fantasy.   I want to love this game, but instead I just really like it. It's one I am always up to play, but fine with not playing again for a while afterwards.

ImZhe,7.7,"Awesome game  Good Things:  -Massive amounts of replayability and strategies can differ greatly from one game to the next based on which cards you draw early on.   -Games are memorable because they each tell their own story through what happens and it is balanced very well.  -Extremely thematic, for example the Fellowship's shortest path to Mordor is through Moria but it is more dangerous since getting revealed while traveling through Moria will cause you to take extra hits of corruption. The second shortest path is over the mountain, as suggested by Aragorn in the actual story, however, for the second half of the journey past Rivendell the Fellowship won't pass by any Free People Strongholds to rest and heal corruption at, it's just a straight trek through the barren northeastern part of the map to Mordor. There is a slightly longer path if you go south, and that path also passes by Rohan and Gondor, so you can warn those nations or rest at the cities if you want but it will take even longer and that extra time is all Sauron needs to crush the strongholds across middle-earth.  A couple issues I have with the game:  -Once you get onto the Mordor track, it's pretty much all dependent on luck whether the Free People will be able to dunk the ring or lose to corruption. This falls flat compared to the rest of the game where you are making strategic decisions and tough choices.  -The different factions should have really used different color plastics, it would have reduced setup time greatly.  -Long learning time, takes a few playthroughs and rulebook checking in order to fully understand how the rules work. Definitely need a committed partner to play against.  -Initial starts feel a little wonky, it is thematic for Gandalf to die and become Gandalf the White but it ends up being you trying to intentionally kill off Gandalf ASAP to respawn him for an extra action die. Similar weird things with the action die for Aragorn and the Shadow leaders.

inaholeintheground,10.0,"  War of the Ring is an epic 2-4 player thematic war game based on the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It pits 1-2 Shadow Player(s) against 1-2 Free People Player(s).    The components in War of the Ring are outstanding. The two boards in the game form a colossal map of Middle-Earth. The miniatures that populate the board are beautifully sculpted and depict the characters that they represent accurately. The red miniatures personify the Shadow Player's hoards of minions, while on the other hand, the blue miniatures portray the Free Peoples Player's small reserve of soldiers. Along side the miniatures are the gorgeous action dice, six for the Free Peoples Player and ten for the Shadow Player. They follow the color coding of the miniatures. Each side has an engraved icon that represents the action you can take with that side. The Giant map of Middle-Earth is complemented by Tarot cards. Both players have two decks of these cards, entitled event decks, which signify notable happenings from the trilogy of books. Overall, the components are amazing.           War of the Ring is played over a series of rounds, each broken down into six phases. The first phase is simple. Each player recovers the action dice he used in the previous turn and draws one card from each of his event decks. Following this phase, the Fellowship Phase consists of the Free Peoples Player making vital decisions for the Fellowship of the Ring, such as declaring the location of the Fellowship, healing the Fellowship, and changing the Guide of the Fellowship. Next is the Hunt Allocation phase, where the Shadow Player can place dice on their 'Eye of Sauron' side in the Hunt Box. The more dice the Shadow Player puts in the Hunt Box, the harder it is for the Fellowship to reach Mordor. If the Shadow Player allocates too many dice into the Hunt Box, the Shadow Player will only have a few actions to spend during the fifth phase. However, the Shadow player can only allocate as many dice as the fellowship has companions. In the fourth phase, both players roll their action dice. The Shadow Player takes any 'Eye of Sauron' results and puts them in the Hunt Box. The fifth phase, the action resolution phase, is the heart and soul of the game. During this phase, the players take turn spending the action dice the rolled to play event cards, muster troops, conduct sieges, make diplomatic actions, and much more. Finally, there is the victory check phase.    War of the Ring is an amazing game. Everything from the mechanics to the artwork is stunning.

Being a Middle Earth afficionado, I'll play War of the Ring as the nearest tabletop experience to recreating events in the LoTR. However, I am often frustrated as the game has a number of flaws. As others have commented, it is basically a slightly more advanced version of Risk with a large number of cards that you cycle through to get to the relatively small number of useful ones. Using dice to drive the game makes it a little different to Risk, but just adds another layer of chance on top of that inherent in the battles and the card decks.  The fellowship mechanics are rather fiddly, considering that it all boils down to chance again - in the hunt die rolls and the drawing of the chits from a bag.     I've just played the game for the first time as a 4-player, and will be very reluctant to do so again.

javitxu83,8.5,"One of the great games that I have played. I love it. I think that it is highly thematic, usually the events that happen on the book are there without you almost noticing, it is highly strategic, it has around 200 miniatures and, above all, it is repayable. One of the things that I like from this game, is the action-reaction structure. With this I mean that if the shadow player decides to attack the Shire, which only worths 1 point, but usually is unprotected because no one expects the shadow doing that move, then the free folks player will have to answer that move, and probably that was not his/her idea at any time. I think that this point is what it makes so great this game and provides some great moments. To me, the only thing that I may not be completely in favor is the ring mechanic. I totally get that this time mechanic avoids the game to go on forever, but it gives like a estrange feeling of victory or defeat, unepic I would say. You are defending Rohan, fighting at Moria and trying to save a desperate invasion at Lorien and then, suddenly, it all ends because you draw a tile with high corruption. It is part of the game and it is ok, but, I mean, it is not as epic as conquering Edoras, Lorien and Minas Tirith. To sum up: Positive: - Highly thematic - Epic battles - Tons of miniatures and components - Highly strategic Negative - Finishing the game by ""Ring"" can be a bit un-epic - It is a very long game. To be planned in advance - There are so many cards and characters and rules that, if you do not play from time to time (maybe once every 9 months) it is a bit hard to remember everything - It is one of those games so complicated that you may have problems for finding a decent adversary (and that will want to play with you more than once)",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.9625325798988342,COMPLICATED,"{'COMPLICATED': {'negative': 0.15292458, 'neutral': 0.037712835, 'positive': 0.8093626}}",COMPLICATED

While this game certainly offers a rich, robust strategic experience, much of the game comes down to which cards you draw, action die results, which tiles emerge from the Hunt Pool, and combat rolls.  Therefore, randomness does play a factor--quite a significant one. However, it is these very design choices that provide the tension, unpredictability, and overall magic of the game. These elements can (and will) lead to moments of frustration and elation for both players. The strategy of the game, then, involves executing and timing your decisions in ways that position you to benefit from the wide range of possibilities the game offers (and having solid contingency plans).

Joey_A,10.0,"Normally, I'm not a fan of games with many dork-dolls (minis to you).  From what I've seen, they tend to be overproduced, under-baked cash grabs.  Chits are vastly superior in every way by virtue of  conveying more information, having the benefit of being space/cost effective.  All while being easier to move and tell apart than a bunch of gray blobs.  Chits!  Now that I've got my propaganda piece for my favorite component out of my system, this game, WITH its many dork-dolls, and ludicrous amount of custom dice (an unnecessary component I do like, as they convey information) actually comes with a rules backbone and wonderful card play that ensures tense battles and seiges every turn.    The game is long, but never draggy, thanks to the excellent balancing ensuring that the early choices you make funnel you down a path towards a tense showdown as you try to get your last point as the little Hobbits try to get their last step.  While much of the game, you are at the mercy of a random number generator, and if you and your opponent both played a particularly excellent game, it can come down to a 50% random chance of either one of you winning, I find this strangely cathartic and satisfying.  The excitement of this is like the tension in a boxing match that looks like it's 50/50 and comes down to the judges for the final decision.  Even if this aspect doesn't sound like your bag, I'd still recommend giving it a shot, because the process to get there is that well developed.",115746,en,1.0,negative,0.49441465735435486,,{},

Excellent stuff and a dream come true for LotR fans.  The movement and battles are reminiscent of Risk, but the gameplay is more card/hand driven with asymmetrical endgame objectives, driving the strategy for both players.  What you end up getting is a real, true-to-form, Lord of the Rings adventure, replete with thematic objectives and sub-objectives that serve to help your main objective succeed.  (Note: I've only played as the good side so far, but my fellow gamer friend seems to love playing Sauron.)   The setup is both long and intimidating, and the many rules can be tough to recall and incorporate without fail every turn, but even when you forget something here or there, the game doesn't suffer greatly for it.  It can drag on if either player isn't familiar with the many rules (or a less common situation that you are unsure about how to hande, e.g. a siege), or if a player takes long in thier decision-making, so be forwarned this is not for the ADHD Gamers; This game is a main event.  Also, you're gonna need a bigger table (said in Roy Schieder's voice for greater effect).    All in all, this is a can't miss, slam dunk game for the LotR fan- and for gamers in general.

JoshmyGosh,4.0,"I should love this game. It is interactive, strategic, thematic, and epic - in theory it is right up my alley. In reality, I find this game to be a slog.   For one, the game has way too many rules for the experience that it offers. Army movement and combat, for example, pretty much boils down to ""move a space and roll some dice"", but it has six pages of rules. I understand that this is called ""chrome"" and it exists to allow wargames to accurately simulate their source material, but the gameplay here isn't too far off from Risk. Risk plus chrome does not equal a good game in my book.  My second big problem with this game is that it is a war of attrition. The primary strategy of the free people is to literally hide behind walls and stall for as long as possible. That is certainly in keeping with the theme of LOTR, but it doesn't exactly make for a fun game. To be clear, there ARE some really exciting and thematic moments in this game, but they are completely buried behind the four hours of tedium (five if you count set up).",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.5649261474609375,,{},

Oh yep, yeah, yes it is. The rulebook is 47 pages long. BUT IT'S SO WORTH IT.  Before we start, this is going to be long. Just a warning. Plus, I'm a huge Tolkien fan, so obviously I'm biased, but I urge you to look past any bias because this game is incredible.  This is my favourite board game ever. It's one of my favourite games ever, period. No matter the medium.  This game is 2-4 players, but really you should be playing this game as a 1v1 duel, because that's where it really shines.  This game is asymmetric. On paper, the Shadow player seems to be far stronger, rolling more dice every turn,, having far larger armies and posing an immediate threat to the Free People in multiple areas of the map. However, as the game goes on, you'll begin to see the fantastic balancing that this game has. Sure, the Shadow player has wiped out Gondor, but they still need to take three more strongholds to win and...the ringbearers have already reached the gates of Mordor?!   It's tense. It's action-packed. It's amazing.  You play as either the Free Peoples of Middle Earth (Dwarves, Elves, The North, Gondor, Rohan), or the Shadow of Mordor (Mordor, Isengard, Southrons and Easterlings) and you play out the well-known War of The Ring (the plot of Lord of the Rings).   As the Free Peoples, you'll be attempting to defend your cities and strongholds from overwhelming forces, while the Fellowship attempts to slip into Mordor undetected to destroy the ring. Moving the ringbearers is a risky move that may lead to Frodo becoming corrupted. Too much corruption and he falls to evil, meaning you lose the game. However, it's a move you must make, because it's the most sure-fire way that the Free Peoples player can win. They CAN win a military victory, and even need less points to do so than the Shadow player, but you have limited resources and leading attacks on strongholds is very risky. If you manage to successfully drop the ring into Mount Doom, congratulations, you win!   As the Shadow player, you'll be aiming to dominate your opponent for a military victory by overwhelming their strongholds with your unlimited resources. When your soldiers die, they return to the pool of available recruits that you can bring to the table. Whereas any Free People warriors you kill are eliminated from the game forever, meaning any victory you score over the Free People, no matter how small, is meaningful. While military victory is your primary means of winning, you can also win by turning Frodo to the side of evil and overwhelming him with corruption. Every time the fellowship moves, or when you find them, you initiate a ""hunt"". If you successfully hunt the ringbearers enough, they will fall to corruption and you win immediately.  Both sides roll multiple themed dice every turn, with the Shadow player rolling far more. These dice dictate what actions you can take that turn. Both players have a hand of cards that gets replenished constantly. These cards can be used either in battle or out of it, giving different (highly themed) effects depending on when and how they're used. The Free People can use the Rings of Power (The rings of Gandalf, Elrond and Galadriel) to change the outcome of some dice, but then those rings become corrupted and the Shadow player can do the same thing, so it's a real risk-reward mechanic.   There's also rules about recruiting new heroes (you can turn Gandalf the Grey into Gandalf the White, or turn Strider into Aragorn) which awards you with more dice per turn. As the Shadow player you are in charge of powerful characters like the Mouth of Sauron and Saruman. These also award you extra dice.  You can, at any point, separate people from the Fellowship and send them on their own to aid armies in battles. Each character has a special power. Some are more useful in the fellowship, some are more useful in their homelands. Gimli, for example, is much more useful in defending the dwarven lands of Erebor than he is walking with Frodo and Sam. These characters can die at any time, and if that character awarded you an extra dice (like Saruman, Gandalf the White, etc) then you lose that dice when they die.   Combat is decided via rolls of dice, aided by any cards you decide to play. Cities and strongholds make your armies stronger if they're defending them. The dice can make it feel a bit too rng-heavy, but to be honest, it's fine. Great, even. It's a very old-school way of deciding a fight and frankly, with how rules-heavy this game is in other ways, I'm fine with it.  Every soldier, hero, and dark champion are all plastic miniatures. The miniatures can be a little bent or misshapen, but they're fantastic and it feels amazing pushing a huge group of orcs toward Gondor while smiling menacingly at your opponent.   The board is HUGE, seriously you need a big table for this game. It's a very well-made recreation of Tolkien's Middle Earth and very nice to look at.   The cards are all themed and make a lot of references to events in the books.  The dice are also themed, with special symbols on them.  Look, I could go on and on and on. This is the best game I own. It's amazing. Fantastic. A blast to play. Yes, it's expensive, yes it's long, yes it's very complicated, yes you'll be checking the rulebook every five minutes. Push through it. It's WORTH IT.

Several paths to victory exist for both sides although the Fellowship will often be key to victory for the Free Peoples and likely should be pushed pretty hard.

lebigot,7.0,"The rulebook is good: it is nicely laid out, clear, and easy enough to use as a reference while playing.   The production quality is good. The plastic is a little soft, but the figures are well sculpted. The game generally looks nice: clear and large map, nice drawings on all the tokens, the card font is relatively large,… Now, the design is not fully functional: identifying the Nation of all the figures is not easy (they should have a colored base), the thresholds for the military winning conditions could be indicated with colored numbers on the victory point track,… Not bad but not perfect.   I found it easy to connect with the theme, except for the occasional card whose title did not ring a bell. The situations that arise in the game are reminiscent of the story (retreating into Helm's Deep is a decision that can reallly make sense, Saruman can easily summon many troops, etc. Now, I still get much less theme than in another longer game like Twilight Struggle, where the pictures help (no pictures on the busy War of the Ring cards), and where the events are more varied and therefore more easily recognizable and enjoyable.   If the theme is less enjoyable than in Twilight Struggle, what remains that could make this game especially enjoyable? Combat is obviously an important facet of this game. But Heroscape offers many more laughs, and Kemet packs combat in a shorter time frame, and gives more diverse fighting powers.   What remains is a game where the theme is well integrated but where it doesn't make the game incredible, and neither do the mechanics.   Another thematic mechanic is the Corruption, and the hiding and hunt of the Fellowship. This mechanics gives some tension but remains relatively simple, with a good dose of randomness (through the hunt dice and the hunt tiles).

The look of dread forming on the Fellowship's face as I played game-breaking effect after effect gave me a sense of validation that I was doing something right.   Yet, when it came time for the Fellowship to play their ""Scout"" combat card, I cried foul about how unfair it was that I couldn't finally [i]eradicate[/i] those stubborn hold outs in their stronghold, take my points, and free up my troops.  The dice activation (strategic uncertainty) is right up my alley. Making lemonade out of lemons is one my favorite things in board games, and this game embodies that spirit perfectly.

littlechandler,5.0,"Initial Impressions: If my initial impressions are correct, this is the most disappointed I've been in a game since Arkham Horror The Card Game. First of all, the general concepts of the game are actually pretty simple. The event cards are really thematic, and the game does have an epic scale and sense of openness to it. The biggest problem with the game though is just the way to convey that epicness is to have a long, sloggy game. The combat is, with some special battle cards, is just roll high and reroll, and gradually wear down the numbers of your opponent. While you can pick the locations of your battles a bit, and a sloggy gradual wear down is befitting of siege warfare, it is too much repetitiveness for me. There are also a lot of events that feel uesless after a certain point in the game. Finally, the fellowship and the hunt for the ring feels anything but. For the most part, the Shadow side can only get corruption when the Free Peoples decides to risk to advance their own track, and so there is none of the cat and mouse that is generally in a hunt with secret movement.  EDIT: My rating stands after my 3rd play. I've gotten the actual playtime of the game down to 2 hours which has made the games less sloggy, but I'm actually  feeling less theme from the cards, since many add overhead without actually making the game feel more thematic. For example, there are a lot of different character cards that just add more units to the board conditionally. This adds overhead because you have to remember what you have to do to play the card. It also adds tactics because it forces you to prioritize things to maximize your cards. However, since all the units do the same thing and it is just where they spawn, it feels really thematically abstracted, and not like you are helping Gondor vs. protecting the elven woods.",115746,en,1.0,negative,0.7689966559410095,,{},

lukestrotz,9.0,"The title is not a misnomer...when you play this you are playing the War of the Ring. That might sound like I'm stating the obvious, but what I mean is, this game delivers exactly what is promises. There is no way to be disappointed by this game, as it meets all expectations. When criticism is leveled at 'dudes on a map' games, I point to War of the Ring as an example of how this genre can get it so very right.   The tension in this game is very real, particularly as the sense of how each side is doing is visible to both players. As Frodo and Sam get ever closer to Mordor, the Shadow player is under increasing pressure to take the final fortress they need to win the game or to try and corrupt Frodo enough for the instant win. And as more and more fortresses fall to the Shadow, the Free Peoples player must either work to accelerate Frodo (increasing the possibility of corruption) or look for the possibility of capturing fortresses themselves.   What perhaps is surprising about this game is how streamlined it is. I mean, the game basically uses the same combat system as Risk. It would have been easy to bloat it up with complexity, like many wargames, and create all sorts of special rules for each event from the books, but I'm glad the designers resisted this urge. The event cards do the job perfectly and do so in way that does not require pages of exceptions.   The only finicky part is the hunt for the ring, but given it's the only finicky part, it's easy to focus on getting right. The rulebook is also not the best and you'll find yourself flipping back and forth trying to find what you're looking for, but if I didn't play games because of poor rulebooks, I'd be missing out on a lot of great games.  I'm not sure the expansions are even necessary for this game, as I doubt I will tire of the base game at any point.

I have trouble finding people to play it against me, unfortunately, as it's a longish investment (3-4 hours usually) and only 2 players.

One of my favorite things is the storytelling flavor- we can tell terrific after-stories of Boromir helping break the siege of Lorien, or the time Merry almost killed Saruman with a Blade of Westernesse. The second edition rebalanced several minor issues with the first edition (some of which had been addressed by the first edition's expansion, which had come with its own issues).

MariusSemeonOrtiz,6.5,"Loved this game the first 7-8 times I played it, and still really enjoy playing occasionally. But after a certain number of play-throughs more of the weaknesses of the game began to surface. For one, the whole western side of the map is often untouched, a huge amount of space which is all too often completely irrelevant. Furthermore I found the dwarves and the north, in about 50-70% of games are either inactive or see one or two instances of combat but are otherwise irrelevant. I think more playtesting would have revealed these flaws and the game could have been more streamlined.  Having said all that I love various features of the game and find the theme and epic-ness of the layout and pieces very attractive. I feel the combat mechanics as well as event/combat cards (and tough decisions of when to play them) are fairly balanced and the difficulty of besieging very well executed.

I reinforced my most important strongholds, pushed hard with the Fellowship, and made it to 3-4 Mordor spaces away from winning the game before Sauron crushed Minas Tirith and cast Middle-Earth into darkness. Just coming that close felt like an accomplishment, given the circumstances.  My dice luck tends to be poor, and one play isn't enough for me to discern how I can manipulate other levers in the game to work around that -- because in a good game like this one, there are always ways to mitigate your bad luck.  The whole experience feels properly thematic. I could picture every conflict in my head through the lens of the books/movies. The mechanics all express and dovetail with the theme -- especially the Fellowship stuff, my favorite aspect of the game.

mawilson4,10.0,"w/Lords of Middle Earth expansion  Epic, iconic ""event"" game that effectively distills the story of Lord of the Rings into both a deeply strategic and deeply thematic experience. Every session will tell a profound story of heroism and/or tragedy, and each game will give you hundreds of decisions points through which to strategize.  It's a complicated, sprawling game, make no mistake. There's a lot to take in. It's also fair to call it a full wargame; the fantasy setting does not mean it's light. But to me it feels more streamlined than some games that lack its weight, both literal and figurative. Setup is laborious but, for example, the game minimizes in-game downtime and upkeep to keep you in the action at all times. It feels like 3-4 full hours of gaming in 3-4 hours, as opposed to many that are just as long but contain a fraction of the immersion.  The chief concern is the fact that the game is best played with a dedicated partner who you can sink into the game with over multiple plays, which can be a daunting ask for some. It will also take 3-4 hours to play, give or take, plus setup and teardown time.  These things will limit its audience, but they aren't a knock on the game itself. To wish the game would reduce setup time, for instance, would be to wish it were less grandiose. This is also true of various attempts to boil the experience down to something that's 1-2 hours; some even from the same designers (they've iterated on WotR on at least a couple different occasions). There's something here that doesn't easily reduce without losing something of its scope and majesty. So for its intended audience (LotRs fans, lovers of thematic games and wargaming enthusiasts), War of the Ring will rightly be the favorite game of many, and will be a beloved collection piece for many more.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.6616188287734985,DOWNTIME,"{'DOWNTIME': {'negative': 0.38398045, 'neutral': 0.13370737, 'positive': 0.48231214}, 'COMPLICATED': {'negative': 0.57340217, 'neutral': 0.11205912, 'positive': 0.31453866}}",COMPLICATED

So all these troops rarely move and fight and are just frozen useless on the map where they are. Their only role is to be a cannon fodder against the attacks of Shadow Armies. So why are they on the map? Just to reflect the book, not to make the game interesting. The only reasonable objective for the Free People is then to forget about their armies and rush the Team of Ring towards Mordor in as few moves as possible.  Besides, there are plenty of tiny mechanisms and heavy texted cards that try to reflect the niuances of the book but from the game perspective are just weird, annoying and barely playable.

I'm sure once one has played the game a few times, the pieces become familiar, but for new players, it can be confusing. I may steal Ricky Royal's idea and put color markings around the bases of the pieces.  This game is actually much deeper than I anticipated. I think the rules for hidden movement of the Fellowship and the rules for hunting the Fellowship by the Dark Forces are sort of genius. Reminds me of the type of out of the box thinking that Mark Herman has used in some of his games. There are actually quite a few cool gameplay mechanic ideas in this design.

I would recommend to any big LOTR fan and any gamers who enjoy asymmetrical, faction specific war games. 10/10",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.9672574400901794,,{},

The theme is excellent, and I really enjoy that it has more of a ""classic Tolkien"" feel rather than an updated version based on the films.

The strategy can be a bit obtuse; similar to Twilight Struggle you have to play and lose once to clearly see what you need to do ""next time"".  My first gripe is that the minis all look very similar. I'd take a can of primer and an airbrush to these if I owned it myself so as to create some distinction between the different factions. My second is that it can be easy for new Free People players to forget they have units under siege. Multiple times I simply counted a stronghold as lost and moved my plans elsewhere, only to realize to too late they my units were simply off on the side of the board, waiting to be destroyed.

Complexity: Medium. # of players: 2. Playing time: See BGG. Player interaction: Conflict. Randomness: Medium - card draw and dice, with some control over how to apply results.  Replayability: Low, once in a while is good enough. The strategy seems fairly straight-forward and the action dice will decide much of what you can do anyway. The theme is strong, so those that like the theme will probably want to play more often. It's too long for what it is though. Fun: Some fun. This looks fun to play with all the different miniatures on the large map. Rolling lots and lots of pretty dice is fun. The hunt for the One Ring is thematic fun. Summoning the Witch King to conquer Minas Tirith is fun (for Sauron). Saying ""Fly, you fools"" when Gandalf sacrifices himself to save the Ringbearer is fun. The fun is mostly in the theme and not so much in the game though. Memorability: Good. This lets the players re-tell the story of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Thematic integration: Great. This is designed theme-first. Components: Great. The different peoples of Middle Earth have different minis. There are lots and lots of minis. The fellowship and Sauron minion minis are high quality and look great. The unique action dice are heavy and look great. The components are certainly not functional however; the minis are a pain to tell apart, they don't really fit in the map regions and the map borders could be a lot clearer.

Expect to mess up 1 or 2 games before you really get the hang of it.   - The game is best when played with two players, who already have some experience.   - If a new player is introduced to the game, tell them about certain events that may happen (Ent invasion in Orthanc).  - be prepared to have your perfect plan destroyed by bad dice rolls.

You don't even have to be a fan of Lord of the Ring to enjoy it, but if you know the story, you will be impressed by how the game is designed with the book in mind, engaging you to make this story lives, again, and again.  That's maybe the reason why this game stay as high depicts years. It respect the original material and provides huge depth in how it can be played. After you first turns, you would think there an not so many way to play, but after the first game, you would instantly think “what if…”.  They are many rules, not that well written, but they all make sense, nothing is clunky.  The game is long, but surprisingly addictive. I'm not sure they are many games 2h+ games that you want to instantly restart a new play when it ends.  It's a confrontation game and not everyone is comfortable with that. I think you shouldn't be too harsh against others when they fail an obvious action: Loosing a 2h+ play because you forgot an obvious rule is not fun, specially when they are many rules. It has to be played with friendliness in mind, for the glory of the story.  Also, battles are resolved with dices, even if it can be smoothed with powers, characters and fortress, randomness is here.  But they are actually not that much battle, as Free Peoples tends to avoid conflict to save it's units and precious time.

nponcian,10.0,"After you play a game, this is what you'd feel: - You played a deep strategy boardgame - You directed your own movie. During the game, you are the one who decides on what to do next with what you have. - You watched an exciting movie. During the game, you don't know what would happen next!  Pros - I played the game solo (controlling both players) and this game really tells a story, a story that is mainly driven by the dice, then your decisions, then by the cards! In my 2nd and 3rd game, I continued the game the next day as it was already late at night, but before I slept during those nights, I was very curious and excited on what would happen next as I don't know either. It really feels like you are watching a story unfold because the players themselves doesn't know what would happen next, just like a movie! To be differentiated with other strategy games (mainly the eurogames e.g. Agricola, Wingspan) where you already have an idea of what the endgame state would be thus no more surprises. Here in War of the Ring, you are not just strategizing for a game, you are also watching a story unfold. While playing, you would ask, would Frodo and Sam reach the peak of Mount Doom? Or will the combined Sauron and Isengard units conquer Lorien before that? It gives this game a great excitement factor as players wouldn't know until they roll all the dice (a.k.a. watching a movie) and alternately strategizing over the dice results (a.k.a. directing a movie).  - A fun wargame. Other wargames I've seen and watched has boring mechanics. This game isn't just tactical or strategic, because for a wargame, this is fun to play!  - Highly replayable. There are lots of points that give this game replayability.  First is it's like chess. Chess is replayable even with a static setup and a fixed goal. What gives it replayability is the tactical competition among players, as a move by one influences what the other would do, which gives it an ENDLESS back-to-back countering of moves between players. If one player doesn't change what he does for every game and has a fixed set of moves, then the other player already knows how to act accordingly and thus have a greater chance to win and take advantage of that knowledge. Same here in War of the Ring. It is the ENDLESS back-to-back countering of moves between players that gives this game infinite replayability, just like chess.  Second, the dice. The dice is the main driver of the story as it tells what the players can do for a turn (and you roll 4-6 dice for the Free Peoples and 7-10 for the Shadow). There will be no game where a player knows what would happen next because the dice are random. Thus if you try to do the same set of moves from your last game, chances are the action dice results will be different now that you need to adapt or change your plan. The slight change in even 1 set of dice results will greatly affect the story from a game to another game. No game will ever be the same.  Third, the cards. This game is like Agricola! If Agricola is considered replayable, then War of the Ring too! First is that Agricola's varied order of action space cards translates to War of the Ring's varied order of dice action results. Then secondly, in both games (Agricola and War of the Ring), you can finish a game without ever using a card, but that would be too inefficient. Just like in Agricola, you have to adapt your strategy to the greater benefits that the cards provide. For example, performing an action manually might give you 2 clay (Agricola) or 2 regular Sauron units (War of the Ring), but when you plan your strategy to maximize the card effects, then you may have 5 clay or 2 elite Sauron units! Just like in Agricola, the cards in War of the Ring influences your tactics and overall strategy. If a card you got in a game put many army units in the north, then strategize around the north and attack that. If on another game, the cards put many army units in the south, then attack the south. If on another game you got many cards that moves or corrupts the fellowship, then concentrate on that.  Fourth, the bluffing aspect of the game. A player may pretend to be trying to do something e.g. a Free Peoples army moving nearer to an empty Shadow stronghold, thus the Shadow player reacts. But then it was actually just a diversion to move the attention of the Shadow player away from another region, thus to the benefit of the Free Peoples as the Shadow spent valuable action dice result just for this diversion. Also in battles, the attacker may play a card face-down, then the defender may also play a card face-down. The attacker wouldn't know if the defender would play a card or not as he is the one that is first to decide. Then, the played cards are revealed at the same time. This is very crucial e.g. for the Shadow player because if he used a card to strengthen his attack but then the Free Peoples limited his attack count, then the boost in attack would have a great lower percentage. This bluffing aspect will give this game an endless sense of mystery and risk management, making such moments a ""Poker"" kind of interaction between the players.  - It's very surprising that the game doesn't tell you what to do but when you play it, the decisions you are unconsciously making will align with the real story! It is really like you are re-writing the story of the Lord of the Rings in your own way. The board game state, the conditions of the characters, the event cards, everything is designed that fits the story very well, incredibly thematic.  - When one finally plays it for the first time, they will feel like they achieved something great in life :D I feel so proud that I received the game on September 1, 2022 and was able to play it the same month, at September 30, 2022. Received the game on the 1st day of the month, played it on the last day of the same month :D  - After learning this game, you would have a better experience learning other games! You would view Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island as a simple game and you would appreciate further that its rules aren't so bad after all :D  Cons  - My 1st game was so unsatisfying and I felt like the game is too scripted with the dice, just ""follow the dice"". No one could enjoy the 1st game because there is a LOT going on, as in A LOT! That is a problem because for most, the 1st game is the deciding factor whether it would be played again or not. Luckily, I did! And my 2nd game boosted it from a rating of 7 to a 10! My 2nd game made me realized this is not a ""follow the dice"" game! My 2nd game made me appreciate the story the game has narrated during the course of the game! But how many people are willing to play a 2nd game again?  - This is the most demanding game that I have played. It requires a lot of time (reading, painting, setting-up), effort, money (game itself, paint), and patience!  - Lots of rules can be streamlined. The rules aren't elegant. Many rules are just forced to fit the theme and balance the game. How is one supposed to remember that when revealing the fellowship, you must count the Shadow strongholds, then when you re-roll for a hunt tile, count all the Shadow strongholds, army units, and leaders. How is one supposed to remember that the eye hunt tile has different purposes for different scenarios e.g. when revealed, when successfully hunted, when in Mordor track. How is one supposed to remember that army units not at war may not ""move"" to other nations but they are allowed if it is a ""retreat"". What the! And don't start me with the endless checklist of movement and battles!  - I spent 28 hours learning this game! - The rulebook explains all the bits of the game, but it is hard to understand as the information is everywhere. It could have been better if it was arranged in a flowchart form. As how it is now, you have to read and understand a lot of paragraphs of text, and remember each and every small rule. If it was a flowchart, then those small rules would be easier to remember because you know exactly when they will happen.  - The miniatures are not color-coded, which is very important in the game. Thus, you need to spend more on paint or whatever style you want just to color even just the bases of the miniatures. - The miniatures are of very poor quality. Many are bended  - Is the board too big? Yes, upon initial look and setup. Now play the game, is the board too big? NO! It is too crowded! Although the rulebook provides ways to handle it, it's still a lot of hassle. The miniatures doesn't fit on the board most of the time!  - It takes a long time to setup, play, and cleanup. Setup can take 1 hour, playtime 6 hours, cleanup 30 minutes, adios a las 8 horas de mi vida!",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.7547054886817932,LUCK,"{'LUCK': {'negative': 0.021201309, 'neutral': 0.042012304, 'positive': 0.93678635}, 'INTERACTION': {'negative': 0.021201309, 'neutral': 0.042012304, 'positive': 0.93678635}}",

Even though there is a steep learning curve and there is a lot to keep track of on top of a long play time, I felt that once you dove in, nothing felt clunky and turn went along at a nice clip.  There is zero downtime, as players are engaged with everything their opponent is doing.  The political track is kind of weak, but then there was not a whole lot of political nuance in the source material.

It truly does evoke the feel of Tolkein's saga, but despite my love for the books, this game is not for me.  Beyond the 3-5 hour play duration, there are several other things about WotR that irk me: Clunky mechanics require players to keep the rulebook handy for constant rule clarifications; limited figurine color palette makes factions of the same player's forces hard to differentiate; dependency on dice results and card draws for actions can railroad a player's choices, making strategizing difficult (especially the Free Peoples player who has less dice); dice rolling for combat results is no better than Risk; and finally, I find the game just too damn stressful.

Rules are complex, but tie well with the theme and make enough sense, that actually once you understand them and start playing, it's not hard to follow them correctly, there aren't that many exceptions.  But with the complex setup, hundreds of pieces, and fiddly rules that require some refreshing every time we open the game, and the fact it's a table hog that we may have to play over several consecutive evenings (so we play it on the floor), the result is we play it only 1-2 times per year.",115746,en,1.0,neutral,0.5435969829559326,COMPLEX,"{'COMPLEX': {'negative': 0.9787235, 'neutral': 0.007776072, 'positive': 0.013500453}}",COMPLEX

I am down to play again, but I don't think I liked it enough to warrant purchasing it. The theme was great, but almost too much. There was a lot going on, and it was hard to keep track of. I like rolling dice to get actions, like in tiny epic galaxies, but this was really rough. I didn't get any will of the west results until about halfway through the game, which really hampered me, and there was nothing I could do about it. I also seemed to get the character movements and muster results at the exact worse times, and it just was hard to do what I wanted. It reminded me a lot of Twilight Struggle in that it felt more like a card game with some map mechanics rather than a map-based board game with some cards, which also wasn't my favorite experience. It was fun and epic, but I just felt like I was too often not allowed to do what I wanted to do, and it made the experience bittersweet.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.8423708081245422,,{},

You're either the ring bearer working towards Mordor to toss the ring into the the crack of doom or you're the shadow faction trying to wreck havoc on the towns before the free player can win. The shadow player has an unlimited army and really has to hammer the towns, but often the points are in the strongholds which are really difficult to take over.  The game is incredibly thematic, but can be fairly dice heavy in spots. This is where I knock points down in the game. Not only can it be frustrating rolling 5 dice and re-rolling them with leaders to not get a single hit, sometimes your guys get smoked with only one guy defending. I don't find it thematic at all in that regard.  The game does feel alive and seeing the armies march across the board or recruit and gather outward is literally awesome to look at.

Luck plays a factor in your tactical options, but does not hamstring you.  In the first game the shadow player had many cards to effect a revealed fellowship, and decimated the party early on, then switched to full-military conquest as the fellowship was a bit more timid to try and move; strong shadow victory.  Second game fellowship split off early and often, sending strong leaders to bolster defenses of Rohan and Gondor and slow down the shadow military machine.  Gollum, Frodo, and Sam claim victory by destroying the ring!  It was 50/50, there were eight search tiles left to draw from, four of which would have corrupted the fellowship and given victory to the Shadow player.  Both games were awesome experiences.

The key regions are too small and overfilled with units/leaders/characters. There seems to be only one way for the ringbearer to travel. No real choices and not different pathes to victory are recognizable after one game. It might be that the game reveals its potential after several plays - but I am not willing to devote this time,115746,en,1.0,negative,0.7281273007392883,,{},

PShway,9.5,"This game is likely my new favorite of all time and will likely be a ten once I play as the Shadow player. Though it is asymmetrical, the mechanics are really tight. For example, our first playthrough came down to the final turn -- I (free peoples) won my fourth victory point; however, my partner (shadow) also attained the requisite 10 vps on the same turn. Talk about snatch victory from the jaws of defeat!  If you are a LOTRs fan, then this is the game for you, bar none. The rulebook is certainly dated and laid out in a weird way, but everything is there. There are quite a few strategic routes you can take on either side, and the random dice rolls and card draws only enhance the experience.  The components are fantastic.  The biggest drawback for most people is the set up. But all you need to do is label what's what with a sharpie on the bottom of each mini and it cuts set up time down considerably -- you're welcome, nerds!  I cannot say enough about this game.

RainOfTacos,10.0,"This is just amazing. The game itself is not only good, but the way the theme permeate between the mechanics it's simply fantastic, elevating it to a state of pure excitment and magic.  About the mechanics, it's really simple the use of dice as an action, but it quickly sets you in a complex situation of how to utilise in the best way the dice that you got, while also not forgetting what you want and need to do. And the cards just adds another impressive layer of complexity, with you trying to do the same thing as i said before, but also in a more tense way, because not only the cards are more specific in their conditions and actions than the dice, the deck is never reshuffled; if you discard a card, you'll never going to see it again! And of course, your deck is totally different from your opponent, adding even more replayability to this immense game.  But by far, the most outstanding thing ""War of the Ring"" does, is it's incredible way of constructing a narrative through your actions, that can diverge in many different levels from the books/movies, and still make it a fantastic experience, especially because it was YOU that built this narrative. The game puts you in that place of writing this epic and being submerged in it, in a way that very few games do, especially in this quality.  The game can be long, it can be heavy, and even tiresome. But just like the books/movies, I will never forget how Legolas died in a diversion, so that Gandalf could lead the Free People to a miIlitary victory, or how just outside Mount Doom, Frodo and Sam lost their hope when they lost the Phial of Galadriel, and succumbed to the corruption of the One Ring.

Ranior,8.0,"War of the Ring is very deserving of the lofty praise it has received. This is an excellent fantasy wargame that does great homage to its source material.   The two asymmetric sides seem and are reported to be quite balanced despite their very different objectives and abilities. The game presents two intriguing and competing areas of concern--the movement of the fellowship and the ring against the watchful eye of Sauron and his minions, but also the great military struggle between the shadow armies and the free peoples. Victory can be achieved in multiple ways for each side, leading to some tense decisions about where to focus attention.   The event cards for each side give many options to have the game play out in unique ways, as does the rolling of action dice every round that constrains each players options.   Rolling all those actions dice, along with standard dice in combat, do have me a little afraid the luck elements here might be just a little much for me. But for the most part it seems there are enough rounds and enough battles that the luck largely should even out throughout the course of most games allowing strategy to win the day.  The rules are a little obtuse in some instances, but overall they help to create a very good game that is very evocative of its theme. Overall I'm quite impressed by my initial play and would love to play more and continue exploring the various intricacies of both sides. I could see this rating going up with repeated plays assuming the game is as good as I currently suspect it is, and if the luck elements turn out to be less impactful to the winner or loser than I am fearing.

No matter how your game ends, you will look up to discover that three hours have flown past.  We kept this game in shrink for almost a year because we were so intimidated by it. But the rules aren't that difficult at all—we watched the entire Ricky Royal play through, which was so thorough that we only had to consult the rulebook twice during our first game. Really, the only things you need are time and table space. I'm so happy to have this sprawling two-player mini-fest. The art is amazing—I love the Oliphants and Nazgul in particular. It puts a chill in your bones when they surround Minas Tirith! I've only played twice so far, as the Free Peoples, but I can't wait to try being the Shadow player.  I only have one complaint. The Action Dice are some of the coolest components I've ever seen—why oh why did they cheap out and give us tiny white combat dice? I'm already looking for replacements as I can't have those disgraceful excuses for dies sullying my Middle Earth.  Lame dice aside, no other game tells epic tales like War of the Ring does. In our first play, Aragorn faced the Shadow at Minas Tirith. He did his best to hold the city, but Sauron proved too much for him. Aragorn was lost, but his sacrifice was not in vain—he provided the distraction needed for the ringbearers to make it to the Crack of Doom.

Its profound thematic approach full of exquisite details makes you feel you're shaping your own destiny in Middle Earth, either by traveling to Mount Doom as Frodo while fighting the Ring's corruption or by seeking the Ring of Power as the Dark Lord, while at the same time you're fighting in a slow cooking pace all over the place in hopes of either survive long enough as the Free People or overwhelm your enemy's cities and strongholds as the Shadow.

I am positive that I would come to the same assesment as for the first edition (rated 8.5):  [i]This is certainly one of best thematic games. The miniatures, the map and the artwork on the cards are gorgeous. After one (and a half) plays it seems as there are a lot of strategies to try out. The Mordor player is certainly creating the game (is he giving the fellowship opportunities to advance; does he attack Gondor, Rohan or the Elves?), while the fellowship player rather reacts to this.   In general I am not a big fan of reading a bunch of cards in each turn. But here I can overlook this easily, since the cards really offer a lot of different possibilities and increase the thematic flair of the game. The only down side I see so far for this game is the very long setup time and the rules.

Pros: - Flawless Middle-Earth theme. - Tactical gameplay. - Clever dice mechanics force you to utilize your options. - A gigantic board. - Gigantic cards. - Finely-sculpted beautiful plastic figures. - The dice make sure that no game will be exactly the same.  Cons: - There are so many rules, and the ones about the Fellowship are simply confusing. Hard to introduce to new players. - Unfortunately, the clever dice mechanics aren't that clever. It makes for a half tactical and half luck-based gameplay that can get frustrating. - Combat also involves a lot of luck.  Final verdict: Tolkien fans like me will love this game and want to play it repeatedly. Don't let the cons confuse you; despite the game involving a lot of luck, the more you play the more you'll know how to get around it. And that's what makes this game beautiful.

Ross_allen,10.0,"While there is a long list of board games I enjoy, none stand out more than War of the Ring (WOTR). After fifteen plays, the popular war-themed, two-player game continues to provide exciting adventures.  WOTR is designed to appeal to two groups: advanced board gamers and Lord of the Rings fans. Others may find themselves in over their heads or uninterested in the theme.   COMPONENTS  After opening the box, you might be somewhat overwhelmed by the miniatures. Between the two armies, there are 205 plastic minis with 34 detailed and unique models. Having so many pieces, organization can be an issue, and the insert that comes with the game only contains two large bins for the minis. However, you can easily solve this issue with a few Plano boxes.   In the game, troops from the five Free Peoples nations are all represented by blue minis.  Likewise, the three Shadow nations all have red minis. This lack of color variety can make it difficult to identify which nation a mini belongs to. But, if you’re artistic, this presents an opportunity for customization by painting them!  WOTR’s board is large, preventing regions from becoming overly crowded. Event cards are tarot sized, which improves readability. Other components, including dice and cardboard tokens, are fairly standard.   GAMEPLAY  WOTR’s publisher, Ares Games, manages to make a complex game play smoothly without sacrificing strategic depth. This accomplishment is largely due to its action dice. Each turn, your dice roll will limit your choice of actions, minimizing the seemingly endless options available.   Asymmetric gameplay makes it essential to understand the basic strategy associated with the Free Peoples player and the Shadow player. Both have different objectives and slightly different rules, which certainly introduces a steep learning curve to WOTR. However, if you decide to invest the time, you will be rewarded with a plethora of strategic variations.   THEME  If you’re a Lord of the Rings fan, you’ll certainly appreciate the game board, which is a faithful rendering of Tolkien’s map of Middle Earth. Character cards and the box are also covered with thematic artwork. All aspects of this game point towards the theme. This is especially true of the gameplay, which often follows the plot of Tolkien’s novels.   Overall, WOTR would make a valuable addition to your board game collection. It’s certainly a time investment to learn and to play, but, within its well-crafted components, deep strategy, and rich theme, you are sure to find a rewarding gaming experience.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.9473729133605957,COMPLEX,"{'COMPLEX': {'negative': 0.10538117, 'neutral': 0.059545882, 'positive': 0.83507293}}",COMPLEX

Rubeus,9.0,"Probably, one of the most complex board games that I have in my collection, a ""wargame"" with a lot of exception rules, flavor and moving parts, in the style of «Twilight Struggle» (CDG), where knowledge of the cards, knowing the strategies with both different sides, control or/and mitigate the (few) moments of luck (there´re dice, which I love!) and, ultimately, knowing when to touch certain buttons at the right moment will be key to achieve victory for one side or another. It´s a deep strategy game. It would be great if it were released a digital version of this game with an A.I. for training and learn the cards and so on, like PlayDek´s «TS». If you love Tolkien's world, I think you're going to enjoy it very much! In addition, illustrations are awesome: I love Alan Lee and John Howe art style for Tolkien´s books.  Some negative points for this game:   1- miniatures are made of a very elastic and flimsy plastic (I had to straighten many of them with hot/ice water technique) and are difficult to distinguish between them (I´ve painted miniature bases). Ares Games should fix this!   2- The Free People blue and Shadow red dice are beautiful, but the white five combat dice are funny, they make me laugh because they seem to belong to a different, cheap game! Ares Games should fix this, too! Anyway... I´ve replaced them with proper five blue and five red dice.   3- There is no opaque black bag for Hunt Tiles (I´ve find one for this).   4- The current price of the game is sooo high! It has risen approximately €20 in no time! It´s a pity actual prices of board games!   5- This is a very HEAVY game, not because it´s difficult, but because rulebook is not well structured, and there´re so many exceptions. Fortunately, there´re very good tutorial videos on Internet: my favorites ones are: 1- ""Box of Delights"" (by Ricky Royal), and those from Agustí Barrio Ruiz (in Spanish).  6- You´ll need plenty of free time to play it. A game takes sooo looooong...  Otherwise, it´s an outstanding game, and I hope to play it often.

Ruud2009,9.0,"05-06-2014. Played War of the Ring 3 times. Once 1st edition, two times using BGG user Fillem's 2nd edition copy. I like 2nd edition better due to the bigger cards and more clear VP marker for the settlements.  I adore this game. There is so much to do, and so many interesting things to do. The way that you roll action dice to determine your action pool for the round is really fun. It means that you have to make the best of the actions given to you. You can buy new troops, move troops, move nations closer to war or move the fellowship. Sauron can hunt the fellowship. Quite like the books :).  The game looks incredible. The game is incredibly thematic, reflecting the books/movies pretty accurately. Sauron starts of incredibly strong and when he unleashes his attack on ME, you're powerless to stop him. Luckily, free peoples players do not have to get Sauron's 10 VPs from military, but just 4 before they win :). Also fun, Sauron has unlimited guys, but the free people's run out and dead units are not replaced, leading to the feeling that Sauron's resources are endless, while you are dwindling. Very nicely implemented.  One nitpick, they could have used different colored plastics for each faction. Different shades of blue for example would have helped differentiating factions to facilitate set-up and would've helped gameplay/strategy as well. I have at times mis-remembered guys or advanced the wrong army because I misidentified the armies.  Yes, the game is long: I suspect around 3 hours per game.

Saume,6.5,"Not my kind of game, just too long for what it is (ultimately just dudes on a map with dice combat).  My first game lasted 6 hours (including a long setup and explanations). There are a lot of stall mechanics when defending, which really elongates a game. These mechanics, however, are somewhat needed given how the map is, otherwise the Free Peoples wouldn't last long. I personally do not feel like a game like this (essentially a dice chucker) should last even close to 3 hours (seems to be around that length after your first game).  A major negative point for me is that the events are all plain text and WAY TOO SITUATIONAL. Most of these events aren't powerful enough to warrant such restrictive conditions. I understand that they wanted to simulated the movies and books somewhat, but this should be our version of the Lords of the Ring. The fact event cards are so verbose also makes it a pain for new players. So much text to read during gameplay. They should've greatly simplified those and tried to incorporate more iconography over long descriptions. I guess on those aspects, this game really shows its age.  The rulebook was around 50 pages, but honestly, it wasn't that bad to read through. While there are many small rules, they usually make sense logistically. It could've been less verbose for sure, though. The only part that was a little more complex in the rules is the Fellowship of the Ring, moving them and the Hunt for the Ring.",115746,en,1.0,negative,0.8162992596626282,COMPLEX,"{'COMPLEX': {'negative': 0.9350118, 'neutral': 0.03899883, 'positive': 0.025989396}}",COMPLEX

Playing as the Shadow, you'll find yourself wielding overwhelming and almost unstoppable force, destroying and conquering everything in your path. Playing as the Free Peoples, your role will be much more about stealth and containment, though you still have a decent—yet limited—military force (since Free Peoples' units that die are permanently removed from the game, whereas Shadow units always return to the supply).

SecretSauce275,8.0,"- very thematic adaptation of the books/movies that lets you replay lord of the rings from the point where the fellowship leaves Rivendell - have to compare a little to Star Wars Rebellion to point out where it shines  - not so good: heavy rules overhead with a couple of extra extra rules for some mechanics that make it longer to teach and harder to comply  - good: each faction can go for one of two faction specific goals to win the game. Dunk ring/conquer map versus corrupt ringbearers/conquer map (however more then Free Peoples). From that, there arises a plethora of options to progress the game while maintaining the ability to pivot from one strategic goal to another which creates a very fine tension  - the game holds it ground where Rebellion unfortunately fails miserably (contrary to public opinion the expansion does little to heal that, if you cared about my perspective): battles are engaging, fun and feel challenging for both sides. Yes, you are throwing dice in the end. However, you need not keep track of different dice colors, strength values and such. There is simply hits or misses, maybe rerolls (if leaders are involved) and over. Tactical elements come from the map (where are you fighting? In plain territory or is one party in stronghold or city/fortification?) and option to continue battle or not. effects from cards add the spice. Cards are not only for battle but could give you some other effect in the game, so modifying combat comes at an opportunity cost. So you are getting what you are promised here: a lot of battles with consequential outcome. Each battle feels like it matters and the map layout impacts your chances: is the enemy on open field or in stronghold? In Rebellion it can happen that the Rebels kill your single trooper on some remote planet and get a point for that… duh… in WotR you know where the points are on the map and armies will move and defend accordingly  - in terms of aesthetics it is trailing a little behind Rebellion.

Our group: FP 3, Shadow 4. *NOTE - all FP victories were against first-time WotR players.  I have only won as FP because I was playing a Shadow player who had never played the game before.  Yes, I know and have employed all the strategy recommendations written for the FP; ""always move the Ring every round, twice in a round when possible."" Moving the Ring twice means you have 2 action dice left for everything else.  All the videos and training / strategy aids say the same things for the FP, there's nothing in them that isn't patently obvious...""move the Ring at least once every game round."" Last game as FP (8/8/'24) moved the Ring 8 times in 6 game rounds.  Rohan fell, all of Gondor fell, Lorien fell...game over.  My Fellowship had 0 corruption and no Companions had been killed. Shadow player just followed a very simple and very obvious strategy; build lots of units, move Armies, attack with Armies...game over by Military Conquest in 6 game rounds 10-0.

Moreover, it would be nice if there was a quick-start tutorial for this game so that you have an easier way to introduce others to War of the Ring.

Additionally, the first game that you play against anyone whom you have to explain this game to extemporaneously, probably wont be an incredibly fun introduction to this board game, because it will be very slow.

Smith606,8.0,"Just as Rebellion is the quintessential retelling of the Original Trilogy, this is the retelling of the Lord of the Rings. Most major book events or highlights are covered in event cards, allowing you to create a loose narrative that loosely mirrors Tolkien's work in a parallel Middle Earth.  An interesting design mechanic that might be infuriating at first is that all your decisions to be made, every round, are largely dictated by rolling dice. You roll a set pool, and the results inform you of the actions you can take. Maybe you planned to do X but only rolled Y & Z results - welp, you need to quickly formulate a new plan. This randomness will not appeal to all.   It's a toss up which I enjoy more out of Rebellion or WotR but they both scratch a different itch, and have a different approach to their gameplay.  EDIT - update with time. I really like this game and enjoy playing it, but after a lot of repeated plays it does feel like a lot of the same paths get tread each time. It's understandable given the context of the source material and the natural board state at the start but it can make for somewhat predictable opening plays.",115746,en,1.0,neutral,0.8164063096046448,,{},
SmittysPub,9.0,"I could not love this game more. It so cleverly and faithfully recreates the mood and desperation of the books, especially as the Free Peoples player. I mean...turn *2* you are already outnumbered and under attack and in a bad place. Awesome!  The combat and combat-to-siege rules can be a tad confusing, but a couple play-throughs and you get there.  The most important thing are all the little rules. There's the standing rules, and the zillion cards that break those rules - normal, right? - but then little individual rules about the Fellowship, Gollum, how they move, how they break...you *have* to know those. So the only knock I have on this game is that there are all these little tiny rules that really make the game so faithful to Tolkien's work, but if you forget them, you've missed a big part of the game.  But good heavens, we love playing it. My 3 boys - 13, 13, 16 - play this with me, and even with the ""little rules"" caveat, they get it, they play well in the system, and the major strategic decisions are well within their intellectual grasp.

snoozefest,9.0,"Comments from plays of 1st edition:  Mar 2005: Haven't played a full game - just got a demo (very poorly run!) at GenCon '04. While it has some interesting mechanics - the race to destroy the ring, the Shadow's search for the fellowship - it seems to be too much of a wargame for me. There are just way too many little pieces on the board. Plus, each country is so small that the hordes don't easily fit (and the ""solution"" of using chits isn't very good)! It may be better as a 2-player game. We played with 4, and had a hard time figuring out which armies belonged to each player. Why use such ugly colors? Why make every good/evil piece the same color? Couldn't Saruman/Sauron and Rohan/Gondor/etc be, at the very least, different shades to facilitate 4-player games?  4/10  Sep 2011: 2er, full game, with someone who knows the rules. MUCH better! The physical production is still a bit iffy -- pieces don't fit in regions, Nazgul are top heavy and need pennies glued to the bottoms to keep them standing, etc. -- but the game play is greatly improved playing this as a 2-player game. Gameplay is very evocative of the theme and story. And there are some very cool mechanisms here:  - the dice-driven action selection narrow the scope of what you can do, which is good for a non-wargamer!, but _should_ average out over time - the search for the Fellowship by reducing your dice pool ... very nice! In fact I like pretty much everything about how the Fellowship is handled: it must break over time, as people are forced to split off to do things; terrific semi-hidden movement system that is both simple and effective in hiding exact location without becoming cumbersome; how Sauron catches glimpses as they move, are found, then hide again. - event cards and dice sort of remind me of card-driven (war)games like Twilight Struggle, which BTW is an awesome game! - combat is tough! Clever to have Sauron's forces unlimited, but have the Free Peoples succumb to attrition through the game. - pretty simple turn structure, really, for such an involved game - the final push up Mount Doom to destroy the ring is appropriately tense!  I'm not sure how much I will like it in the long run, though: there are an awful lot of dice rolling here and I tend not to like those types of games. And the game is somewhat long, although that isn't necessarily a problem for me. But looking forward to trying it again! 7/10? ",115746,en,1.0,negative,0.6077488660812378,,{},

While I can on board with the LOTR stuff, the length and especially the intensive learning curve: we played for 3 hours and had hardly moved along at all. You have to look up everything, some people online say you should just keep going, you don't need to understand everything but I found it hard to make any decisions if I don't know what is going and what are the consequences. But even if I could muster up the patience to learn this, I don't think I would like it. The dice combat system is bad, it is not better than your outdated Risk combat and that is at least quick. It seemed as if no matter what you strategized and cards you played, the dice just decide and anything else doesn't matter. I hate that mechanic. And when you pair with endless lengthiness that boils down to whether you can roll a 5 or a 6, I am a bit pissed to be honest. Additionally, the looks of the game are a bit disappointing. Lots of minions and a cool map board but I have seen better looking games, and similar games that pull of a better design.

steve0216,9.0,"Love this game - and finally got my (mostly lighter weight gaming) better half to play - and lo and behold, she enjoyed it as well!  Given multiple paths to success, I had lots of fun playing as the fellowship, and whats-her-face truly enjoyed the prospect of quashing me like a bug under the unceasing onslaught of her grist-mill of units playing as Sauron.  Card plays in this game can wildly swing what would be an almost untenable situation into a complete reversal (for both parties). I would call the game well balanced, with unique abilities given to special units on both sides, this does lend itself to the gut wrenching moments when you realize that due to not keeping track of such-and-such special piece - your opponent is now rolling 47 dice against your 2 and you're doomed if you lose. But that's allright, because next turn it may be the complete opposite!  Rules certainly can be a chore to slog through the first time you play - but after a few rounds with the exception of some more esoteric situations, playthrough goes smoothly once you get the hang of the turn-order and any quirks for your player.  Component quality is very good - box contains a massive amount of drunkenly leaning figurines (which can be hard to differentiate). Artwork is good and I think lends itself to immersing you in the game effectively. board itself is ginormous, and has a feel of quality to it (Heavy is good, heavy is reliable)... Do yourself a favor, and get some color-coded dice for each player, as the (tiny!) generic dice are a little lacking.  This is very likely a game that is mostly only appealing to Tolkien fans, or massive boardgame nerds, but for those who are - this is a veritable fetishist-class dork-gasm:",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.9800499081611633,,{},

Only two gripes: 1) The rulebook is dense and poorly organized, making the initial learning of how to play somewhat more difficult than it ought to be. 2) There are some poor cosmetic decisions that were obviously made with lore in mind, instead of tight-user friendly gameplay. For instance, it can be difficult, at a glance, to distinguish which orcs belong to the armies of Mordor, and which fight for the white hand of Isengard. The distinction is important from a gameplay standpoint, and I feel they could have done it better.  Both of these complaints, however, are entirely cosmetic. A real gem of an exciting, strategic wargame lies underneath them, and you should absolutely own this game if you are at ALL interested in the subject matter.

The 'Lord of the Rings' theme is woven so well into the game's art and mechanisms. Each character's abilities feel well thought out. Many of the cards use memorable moments from the books, but, when played, create new scenarios in the story of your specific game.  I still think that a player who is unfamiliar with The Lord of the Rings could enjoy the game, however. The games mechanisms, while extremely flavorful, still feel fun to use and create a tense confrontation between the players. Each session I've played has felt like it's comes down to pivotal moments that could have decided the game for either side. The last time I played, I had Frodo fall to the corruption of the ring on the very last step of Mount Doom! I always feel like I spend even more time after each game considering how I could play better or what strategies I might try.  The game's one downfall, in my mind, is its massive playtime, making it a challenge to get to the table often. This combined with its extensive rules mean there’s always a bit of relearning to do.

It has everything from rings of power, to every major nation, to politics, the one ring, frodo/sam, corruption, the fellowship, nazgul, gandalf the white, saruman, sauron, the witch king, story references like the Ents in Fangorn and more.  Ultimately the game is really like two games in a box.    One is a complex game of Risk like strategy where you are moving around armies, getting them politically engaged to become at war, and trying to capture cities and strongholds.   The second involves the ring and the corruption of the fellowship where the shadow player spends some of his/her effort to hunting down the fellowship while the free peoples player tries to guide the fellowship into mordor and destroy the ring.  During this process, the game even forces and entices the player to split the fellowship.  This allows the player to perform other actions to help with the battle going on.  The ring/corruption objectives are a great counter to the complex strategy of the war mechanics as they add heavy press your luck elements, seen mostly in lighter games.  It is a great way for a player who is doing poorly in combat to donate more effort into and still try to achieve victory.  I absolutely love this game.  My biggest gripe is that there are tons of figures, and it is HORRIBLY difficult to tell between nations of the free people, their figures all look the same.  Additionally, it is really quite complex and heavy.  This isn't a game you can quickly jump into, however, should you have 4-8+ hours to drop this is an amazing game to pull out.",115746,en,1.0,negative,0.47764402627944946,LUCK,"{'LUCK': {'negative': 0.4636147, 'neutral': 0.31962103, 'positive': 0.21676432}, 'COMPLEX': {'negative': 0.62188303, 'neutral': 0.22186482, 'positive': 0.15625215}}",COMPLEX

tata_duende,10.0,"Having played nine games in the course of several years I must confess that for my personal taste it is the best board game ever made. It is tense. It has tough decisions. It’s well balanced. It’s nice looking, it’s dripping with theme and I don’t find it utterly long (3 to 4 hours as experienced players). I love ❤️ it. A 10 out of 10. The expansion don’t improve it a lot but give more options and are a must have.   A must buy for everybody who likes heavy and deep strategy games and doesn’t care about if the games last a little longer.  Even though Star Wars Rebellion hits the same spot, is a little faster and is a masterpiece on its own, I like this game a little more.  ",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.9742586016654968,,{},

tboys,9.0,"3/16/2017: Played it for the firs time. There are just so many rules in the game that I might need to clarify. The game has a very steep learning curve. Playing this game really feels like you are creating your own Lord of the Ring story out of each game and you can tell a story on how the winner won the game. Aside from the steep learning curve, the game also plays for 4 hours which is a bit long for a game. It took us quite a bit of time to read through the Event cards and understand how each one of them bends the rule. Having said that, I definitely going to get this game to the table again and hopefully play the game with the right rule this time around in shorter amount of time. :)",115746,en,1.0,neutral,0.6995860934257507,,{},

I don't love Lord of the Rings as much as some people, and I'm not crazy about minis, but this game is a real beaut. Very few games nail the feeling of maneuvering as well as this one does, and it captures the desperation of the good guys and the plodding imperialism of the bad guys. Even more, interestingly, it doesn't require you to reenact the books.    I could take or leave the actual combat system, but it adds enough spice to make it worthwhile. The fun for me is the lead-up to conflict because often the game is won or lost before you get there.   The card play and action selection makes every decision meaningful, and I can't recommend this enough.

This means that most battles feel unwinnable and the game would be much shorter if it weren't for this one issue. I've only played once so far, so hopefully this will improve with more plays.  That issue aside, the gameplay is pretty unique and has an epic feel because of all of the different armies and Frodo's quest to secretly enter Mordor.

Right from the get go, the game hooks you in from the Hunt for the Ring to the intensity of Combat. There is a presence of progression and increasing stress as it's really a race between the Free People's journey to Mount Doom and Sauron's mass destruction of settlements. I have to say, though, that the Shadow Player winning by corruption is not as satisfying.  Time Value: 7/10  This game is really long, especially in the first playthroughs. However, because the game hooks you in, you don't really feel the length as much as I expected. Each stage of the game feels busy with planning and action. However, there is unfortunately some downtime in the first few playthroughs as people ares till trying to understand what to do.  Mechanics: 7/10 Because there is so much random elements in this game such as the actions available, the combat system, and the hunt for the ring, I initially thought that it would require so much luck. And, it certainly does require luck. However, not as much as I think it would. In fact, the game is so asymmetrically balanced that it really requires good strategy to win games and luck is really only an issue when you poorly managed the game. Speaking of asymmetry, each side has so many cool elements. The game's balance also connects really well with its theme, meaning that all the asymmetrical aspects really do make sense. However, back to the topic of randomness, it still kind of sucks that you need to rely on luck in situations where you put yourself in the best position, and you end up losing the battle.  Replayability: 25/30 Even though I will only play this game 5 times per year, it still is a game I look very much forward to because of how much fun it is and how each game will feel different. I only wish the game is slightly shorter so there I can play even more, but it is what it is. Conclusion: 9 stars (86/100) This is overall an excellent game. The game is both thematic and enjoyable as it really feels like an epic story as you retell the Lord of the Rings. If only the game was slightly shorter and there was less randomness, War of the Rings would honestly be a perfect game.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.9625399708747864,LUCK,"{'LUCK': {'negative': 0.124451526, 'neutral': 0.03876694, 'positive': 0.83678156}, 'DOWNTIME': {'negative': 0.124451526, 'neutral': 0.03876694, 'positive': 0.83678156}}",

Well, this bad boy has been ranked as the #1 thematic game for a while (as of July 2015). What an experience! The theme and the game is fantastic! The game pits the forces loyal to Sauron against the free peoples of Middle Earth. The free peoples must decide whether to allocate their resources to the fellowship or towards the military of the different nations. They must decide if the companions of the fellowship are better served accompanying Frodo and Sam, or off rallying and supporting the troops of the free people. Sauron must decide if he will strengthen his armies to destroy the cities and strongholds of the free people, or focus on finding the ring and corrupting its bearer. The game is balanced on a knife edge, and is just excellent. And the story! It is really neat to re-write the Lord of the rings as you want to tell it. All the same places are there, all the characters are there, but the story is yours. Want to take the fellowship North to Erebor? Go for it! Want to have Gimli carry the ring bearers up the side of Mount Doom? Go for it. The game lets you tell the story, and it is a very good story indeed.",115746,en,1.0,positive,0.975078821182251,,{},

Probably the most flavorful LOTR game I've played, and being the LOTR fan I am that is enough to move it to my top game list.

My friend and I moved on from Star Wars Rebellion to War of the Ring and we have never looked back. We have upwards of 30 plays of this game over the last 3 or 4 years.  2) It is best with 2 players though you can comfortably fit a 3rd player into the Evil side. I wouldn't try with 4 people.  For me War of the Ring is a pinnacle of game design and simply the best two player board game out there. It is extremely rich in theme (obviously you have to like Lord of the Rings). The game board is well laid out and presents all the information clearly. The asymmetric design works amazingly well and each game feels well balanced and fresh due to the use of card decks which help to randomize where the action takes place.  Works very well as just the base game but we also use the Lords of Middle Earth expansion which adds some cool new characters. We didn't bother with the other expansion which adds more army types because we feel that side of the game is fleshed out enough.

The fellowship is trying to get to Mount Doom before the ring corrupts them, while the shadow player tries to gain a military victory by conquering strongholds.  The mechanics are similar to Battle of Five Armies, using action dice and event cards, but the game plays very differently.   The free people must balance their actions into getting to Mordor without gaining too much corruption, and not being overrun by the red armies. The shadow player must use his superior numbers to conquer strongholds, while constantly trying to find the location of the fellowship.  This game is a step up in complexity from BoFA. It has a lot more options. Although you are more or less shoe-horned by the event cards into re-playing certain parts of the books, there is more than enough freedom to make your own story.

Rather than any resemblance of efficiency, play becomes either short FP win, or barring decent luck from FP, a long and tedious struggle for SP. Usually FP wins militarily, and ignoring ring move entirely reducing the game to a game of maneuvering which it is not exactly suited.  FP win quite frequently by getting straight into Mordor or pick other forts early on and basically just give up the ones that are irrelevant once armies are mustered. If baddies defend strongly, they cannot muster sufficient force to attack. If the FP get army moving instead of sitting an waiting to be killed in forts that they cannot hold anyways, they are very hard to stop. Played both sides in equal measure and last >13 games, the goodies have won militarily every time.

Walker1,9.5,"Amazingly thematic! Truly is Lord of the Rings in a box. The foundational rules and game flow are actually pretty simple, it's the variables and modifiers to the base mechanics that require a deeper dive at the front end to figure out (with the understandable need to frequently check and double check the rules as you work your way through certain elements of the game - esp. around the fellowship and the hunt).  Series of walk-through videos on youtube by 'Ricky Royal' were very helpful.   The playing time listed is no joke, as you are easily looking at around 3+ hours for your first play-throughs. I imagine you could stream line things as you become increasingly familiar with the game, but the funny thing is I don't know that most would. This is one of those massively deep and rich gaming experiences that after a game or maybe two, one would likely shelve it for a bit (kind of like watching the LoTR movies back to back, generally one just doesn't do this).

The scale of this game and the story it tells are amazing. Yes, it has a significant luck factor and there's a ton of dice chucking, but War of the Ring somehow manages to make it fun. Everything just works as it's glued together by this fantastic theme - chaos and randomness are just a part of the narrative.     I've painted all the minis in their respective nation colours, added custom-made card holders and a black leather bag for the hunt tokens and upgraded all six-sided dice. It really facilitated and improved the whole gameplay. I've also painted the custom made 3D model of Mount Doom to further enhance the look of the board.   [B]/update, March 2019:[/b] Don't listen to people who say that this game is terrible with 4 players, we had a TOTAL BLAST playing it in teams. It's a different experience, but really wonderful - sharing all your highs and lows with a teammate is something you can't experience in a 2-player game. The only thing I'm not sure I like yet is the fact that one of the winning allies ""wins more"" - this may cause some weird ""semi-cooperative"" instances (""my ally has more points so I will play selfishly to beat him, which may cost us the game"" type of a thing). We just split the victory 50/50 and it felt great. Still, rivalry within factions is an appropriate thematic touch so maybe the final scoring part will grow on me.

zerbia88,10.0,"War of the Ring is  both a tactical and thematic experience. I went in to the game expecting a tight, well balanced war game. I came out with more of a feeling of having been thrust into the Lord of the Rings movie universe. Lord of the Rings is my favorite movie series and so I was heavily invested in all of the thematic touches. All of the cards are extremely tied to the events in the film. How the board is set up is almost an exact set up of how the military forces in the movies were positioned to start. And how the mechanics in the game are structured, you will feel like every choice you make is tied to the movies. Is it a tactical Euro strategy game? Yes. Is it a thematic, roll the dice, ameri-trash game? Yes. I would argue its both. Therefore it will feel unlucky, and your strategy will be disrupted by dice rolls. But that's where some of the thematic experience will flourish. My friend attacked me in Helm's Deep, and through crazy dice rolls we decimated each other's armies. My friend took Helm's Deep but I was quickly able to take it back which made it feel very like the movies. Even if events don't go as they happened in the film's, you will find yourself smiling at how you get to change history. My advice for people interested in this game is to be prepared for deep tactical decisions and planning but with lucky outcomes.

_The_Inquiry_,5.0,"Prior to 2020: 2 plays  This is one of the hardest games for me to rate, honestly.  There's so many things to love about this game - the tactical hand management, the strategic positioning, the epic scope - coupled with so many things that irk me - reasonably boring combat resolution, fiddly case-specific rules, and a really long playtime.  I can't, however, contest the claim that this is ""Lord of the Rings, in a box"", because it most-certainly is.  There's few games that are able to create something as true to their source material as War of the Ring, and even fewer that manage to be as engaging and interesting.  War of the Ring also really has no contest among other ""epic"" two-player games.  It's a game that tells compelling stories and creates memorable moments in each play, but it's also a game where those 5 minutes of memorable moments can only be reached when surrounded by 3 other hours of mediocrity. It's fiddly as hell and also sometimes wildly swingy, but, as I've said before, it's just so epic even in the midst of these problems.  And, honestly, I'd play it again in a heartbeat if asked to play.  It's a game I should have no desire to play based on its transgressions, yet it's a game I can't forget.  So that's worth something, I suppose.",115746,en,1.0,negative,0.5017372965812683,,{},
