The project mainly focuses on the sentiment analysis performed on the comments of the users from the website BoardGameGeek (BGG). It focuses on some
particular aspects of the game and provides the sentiment label as positive, negative or neutral along with the sentiment score. A pre-trained model is used from
the BERT and used for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis on the dataset of the
comments of one of the top 10 games.
